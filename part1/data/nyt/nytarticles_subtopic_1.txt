The responses below have been edited and condensed.I am divorced, and I live with my parents. I moved home to Minnesota from Texas and decided to continue pursuing my bachelor’s in psychology that I had abandoned after having started school in the fall of 2005. I have been attending classes part time while working full time to keep my health insurance since the summer of 2016.I am on track to graduate next fall. All the while, I have been fighting with chronic pain from a horseback-riding accident and managing depression. Some days I have purpose and a drive to succeed, and other days I just want to give up. If you really want something in this life, you have to find that resilience to pursue it and just keep going.As a result of growing up in a broken and traumatic home, I began experiencing severe anxiety and depression in middle school. While it followed me throughout high school and college, I channeled my struggle with mental illness into the founding of a social enterprise, LEAD (Let’s Empower, Advocate and Do), that provides mental health training and curriculum to schools, camps and youth-serving organizations across the country.I am a senior undergraduate student and was recently named the third-best student entrepreneur in the country in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization Global Student Entrepreneurship Awards.I have struggled with clinical depression and anxiety since my sophomore year of high school. I am a sophomore in college, and I am very passionate about mental health and working to improve it.I read a lot of self-help books in high school, but most were written by a 50-year-old psychologist who knows what they’re talking about in a clinical sense, but not how it actually feels to be 16 and struggling with suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. Because of this, I decided to write a short book with practical advice for improving your outlook on the world and how to incorporate caring for your mental health into your routine through mindfulness, exercise, limited phone time and leaving room for what brings you joy in life.I have conducted a workshop at my high school on improving mental health and also do my best to bring that conversation to Wake Forest.My main philosophy is about learning how to make Tuesday your favorite day of the week, because if you’re always waiting for the weekend or Christmas or your graduation, you are deciding that your happiness is circumstantial, and that therefore you don’t control it, your environment does. However, if you decide that amid the boring, mundane, stressful and sometimes heartbreaking realities of life, that you are going to focus on what is good and build your life around that instead, you are taking back the control that you deserve over your own happiness.I am in my second semester of graduate school, studying for my master’s in public administration, with a focus in gender-based violence. Within my first weeks of being here I witnessed a homeless woman being raped outside of my apartment and obviously called 911.This in many ways was triggering to me, and I went into my first semester of grad school suffering from pretty severe post-traumatic stress disorder, from both this and a previous incident. This is all happening as the Kavanaugh hearings are happening, and I am taking my first gender-based violence class of my program. As I was taking the bus to and from work every day, I was entirely dissociative.I likely could not tell you what happened my entire first month of grad school, that’s how detached I was from reality at that time. Luckily, I took the day off for Rosh Hashana and went to the market, and I was able to snap back into reality in a lot of ways. That day I made an appointment with my campus’s sexual assault resource center. It was able to get me extensions on assignments, set me up with a therapist and wrote a letter of support for my department allowing me to drop the gender-based violence class and receive a full refund.I also saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed beta blockers, which have helped bring down my heightened sense of danger wherever I go. This semester, having had time to help heal, I’ve been able to restart my concentration in gender-based violence, which is more important to me now than ever, and I was still able to complete my other two graduate courses last semester and remain a full-time student.It was so important for me to write you, to emphasize the importance of institutional support. I still struggle sometimes, but I think that without them helping me, I likely would have had no choice but to drop out and move back home.I always knew that coming to study at another university in a foreign country is tough. You sleep and breathe in English, you learn to embrace flip flops in the classroom. You adapt. And that was part of my plan.I embrace new opportunities, learn as much as I can, make mistakes, make friends, have first drinks, pull all-nighters. But depression was never part of my plan. I didn’t even know it had a name until everything felt empty.So, here I was, FaceTiming my mother without the video because I could not let her see my face. My voice sounds fine, telling her I was fine, schoolwork is challenging but manageable — I am applying to summer internships, competition is rough, but it’s fine. And everything was fine. Except me.The first time I had a counseling session was weird. It felt weird that I was living my dream, studying in the United States, having supportive family and friends, and yet I was sitting in that chair. I learned that sometimes there was no definite reason for the way I felt. But at least, when I acknowledged that I was not mentally healthy, it was the beginning of my healing process.Every day I try to make healthier choices and balance all aspects of my life. I go to counseling. I practice mindfulness. I talk to my support network. The chemicals in my brain sometimes act up, but I know I just need to be extra patient that day.If there is a mental health group on your campus that could provide support, definitely check it out. Every single time you feel that you are trapped in your head, remember that every little step to make yourself feel better is a step, as long as you don’t stop.AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLONDON — Oprah Winfrey and Britain's Prince Harry have teamed up to produce an Apple documentary next year aimed at raising awareness of mental health.Harry, who revealed he had come very close to a breakdown after the death of his mother Princess Diana when he was 12, has made mental health campaigning one of his priorities.Harry's frank disclosures about his own torment helped to break down some of the current British taboos over discussion of mental health issues in public.He and Winfrey, one of the world's most influential media moguls, have been working on the project for a few months."I truly believe that good mental health – mental fitness – is the key to powerful leadership, productive communities and a purpose-driven self," Harry said in a statement."Our hope is that this series will be positive, enlightening and inclusive – sharing global stories of unparalleled human spirit fighting back from the darkest places, and the opportunity for us to understand ourselves and those around us better."AdvertisementSupported byBy J. David Goodman[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]On his now-frequent tours of early presidential primary states, Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken to invoking a less-familiar aspect of his tenure: a nearly $1 billion plan to address mental illness in New York City.Mr. de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, has done the same, presenting the effort as a national model to audiences from Atlanta to Seattle.The mental health initiative, known as ThriveNYC, is crucial to Ms. McCray’s potential as a future political candidate, and has become increasingly important to Mr. de Blasio as he toys with a possible 2020 presidential bid. He now regularly names Thrive as one of his administration’s core achievements.“It’s revolutionary,” Mr. de Blasio told CNN’s Symone Sanders during a recent forum at Harvard University.But back home, the effort, now in its fourth year, has sputtered. The plan, which includes dozens of discrete programs across 15 city agencies, has undergone two leadership changes in the last year; the most recent saw a top official from the Police Department, Susan Herman, taking charge last month.Ms. McCray, who created and oversees ThriveNYC, faced tough questions on its performance and spending during a packed special hearing of the City Council on Tuesday. The city comptroller is also investigating.During the hearing, Ms. McCray distanced herself from the operations of the program, and left it to Ms. Herman and a budget official to answer many of the more specific questions.“Susan Herman does the day-to-day management and makes the decisions,” Ms. McCray said when asked about her role, adding that her role was to amplify ThriveNYC’s “message to the public.”Pressed on how much of the program’s budget went to the seriously mentally ill, Ms. McCray responded by questioning how that category is defined. Roughly 10 percent of the Thrive budget, more than $30 million in the current fiscal year, goes to address serious mental illness, according to City Hall. (Separately, the Health Department spends nearly 10 times as much on the seriously mentally ill.)Ms. Herman stressed more than once during the hearing that Thrive was “not a new mental health system.” That message contrasted one repeated by Mr. de Blasio, including during a radio interview on Friday. “Before the Thrive initiative,” he said, “there was not even a pretense of a mental health system in the city.”For all the talk, the initiative has been less sweeping than envisioned: A third of the budget has not been spent, according to an analysis of city data by The New York Times. Repeatedly presented by City Hall as a four-year $850 million plan, city officials now say $560 million will have been spent in that time.The biggest challenge for Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray has been to identify concrete results. A spreadsheet of nearly 500 data points tracked by City Hall included almost none related to patient outcomes.City officials, for example, could not say how many people have been connected to treatment after calling the city’s new mental health hotline, because fewer than 10 percent agree to a follow-up.“It is a hard thing to measure, because it’s never existed before,” Ms. McCray said in an interview at Gracie Mansion last month. “So, what are the right measures?”At least one available barometer hinted at the challenges that the city still faces in dealing with mental illness: More New Yorkers dialed 911 to report a person in the midst of a mental health crisis last year — 179,000 calls — than at any point in more than a decade.Public health officials credit the plan for drawing attention to mental health, often too easily ignored by political leaders. Ms. McCray, for example, seldom talks about Thrive without imploring audience to repeat the number of its mental health hotline, 1-888-NYC-WELL.At the same time, some initiatives failed to get started, while others placed unrealistic demands on already strained mental health services.“Are we there yet? No,” Dr. Gary Belkin, a top health official and the chief of policy and strategy for Thrive, said of using the hotline to connect people to care effectively. “But we’ve built the structure that can get us there.”Much of the development of Thrive was personal, born of Mr. de Blasio’s and Ms. McCray’s own difficulties navigating the mental health system on behalf of their daughter, Chiara, who struggled with depression and drugs during high school and college.“It was not as obvious what I, as first lady, would take on; I wanted to take on something big,” Ms. McCray said in the interview. That first year, she began talking with Dr. Belkin. She took a mental health first aid course in October 2014.Over the next four years, Ms. McCray would transform herself into a mental health evangelist.“What do they always tell you when you’re in high school or in college? You should choose to work on something that you would do without pay,” she said. “And guess what — I finally found it.” (She receives no pay for her city work.)Not all of the programs in her plan were new. The city invested heavily on mental health before the de Blasio administration: For example, the Health Department spent $243 million in the 2014 fiscal year on mental health contracts. With Thrive, spending rose to $346 million in fiscal year 2018, according to an analysis by the City Council.Besides the ramped-up spending, a big part of Thrive has been Ms. McCray’s advocacy. She has traveled the city urging New Yorkers, particularly in black and Hispanic communities, to open up and to erase the stigma around mental health. She occasionally speaks of her own experience with therapy, and in the interview, she spoke obliquely of her brief return to treatment last year. “Something happened that triggered the need for me to go,” she said without elaborating. “I felt like I was not able to function.”But City Hall is still struggling to quantify the payoff from her efforts. Dr. Belkin said that while suicide rates are not the best measure, the Health Department has been looking at trends in suicide attempts, based on emergency room visits. Officials are also collecting survey data. (According to data provided by the city, surveys of about 10,000 callers to NYC-WELL since late 2016 found about 60 percent felt better after calling the number.)One indicator of the need for services: The phones at NYC-WELL ring constantly, 180,000 times in 2018, according to city data. (Some are repeat callers, with a few who call as many as 200 times a day.)The call center, operated under city contract, took over the old Lower Manhattan offices of a city suicide hotline known as LifeNet, a service with calls that peaked at 105,000 in 2014. During a recent visit, a screen played YouTube videos of adorable animals, to help soothe staff members who work in sound-dampened cubicles. The service also includes text and web chat.People can receive confidential crisis counseling and referrals. But the interaction is not therapy, cautioned Dr. Anitha Iyer, who helps oversee the call center. “That’s a misconception that people often have,” she said.Few of those who dial the number agree to a follow-up call, making it hard to gauge its effectiveness. So far, almost all of the information on follow-up care comes from the limited cases in which a social worker and psychiatrist have been sent to visit the person.And even some experienced in mental health services have been surprised at what the service does not offer.A retired psychiatric social worker dialed NYC-WELL last year hoping for a nonpolice response for his 37-year-old son, who had been making threats and had a history of manic episodes. The father asked for a psychiatrist and a social worker to be sent to the home.He was told a team like that could not come for at least a day, maybe two; for immediate help, call 911.“They sent a whole army of police,” said the father, who asked to be referred to only by his first name, Ralph, to protect his son’s privacy. Initially, his son refused to cooperate. “That escalated the situation,” he said. The officers eventually brought him to Elmhurst Hospital, nearby.Mental health advocates have been pressing the city to overhaul how emergency personnel respond to situations involving people experiencing the effects of severe mental health issues. But the police are still often the only ones available to respond quickly to calls, even to the mental health line.The Thrive program budgeted millions to create diversion centers, a place other than jail for officers to bring those experiencing a mental health crisis.But problems with the city’s initial proposals delayed the process, those involved said. Two locations have been selected, in East Harlem and the Bronx, but neither has opened yet. More than $15 million has been budgeted over the last three years for the effort; none has been spent.“They have good ideas, but the implementation is what they stumble on,” said Steve Coe, the chief executive of Community Access, which provides housing and other services to the mentally ill.Thrive’s primary focus is on the other end of the spectrum: New Yorkers who have less serious and possibly undiagnosed mental health problems, a population that according to City Hall encompasses 1.7 million city residents.To serve that population, the city is spending $12 million a year on the NYC-WELL hotline — not including nearly $11 million spent on advertising in 2017, mostly to promote the service.Another prominent element of Thrive is an expansion of mental health first aid training. Health Department employees now conduct the eight-hour classes daily at churches, schools and community centers.Ms. McCray implores those she meets to take the course, which includes discussions and role playing. So far, she has not been able to get the mayor to take it. (“He’s kind of busy,” she said.)But the vast majority of city spending on the program goes to more than 40 other endeavors, such as a crime victim advocate program; social and emotional learning in public schools; and a corps of young behavioral health clinicians paid by the city to work at nonprofits for three years.Even as the city has poured money into mental health programs and training, nonprofit directors said they still struggle with providing treatment, citing inadequate Medicaid reimbursement rates and even less generous reimbursements from commercial insurers. Some have closed their doors; others have chosen to stop providing mental health services.David Woodlock, president of the Institute for Community Living and a former top state health official, praised Ms. McCray for her courage in taking on mental health issues. But he bemoaned the inadequacy of state funding, and called the city’s contracting process broken.“People are being asked to do more in this system that is not built for expansion,” he said.Helping the seriously mentally ill remains a challenge, especially in a crisis. Those moments often involve the police, and have led to confrontations where officers have been injured, and the person the officers came to help getting physically hurt or killed.During one such episode in 2012, a man whose family members called 911 to try to help him, attacked one of the responding officers, stabbing him in the neck and face.The man, Benedy Abreu, 31, served five years in prison and is now in a program funded through Thrive to help those with serious mental illness and a criminal past. He receives regular visits from a psychiatrist and a peer counselor.“Everyone in life goes through something,” said Stacey Hamilton, 52, a peer specialist and social worker, reassuring Mr. Abreu during a recent visit that he, too, could become a peer counselor and recalling her own history of mental illness and incarceration.Later, she wondered aloud whether her work with men like Mr. Abreu would be enough. “If this is the highest level of care,” she asked, “how many success stories are there really?”In an earlier version of this article, the location of a community class was misidentified in a photo caption. It took place at the Metropolitan College of New York, not at Manhattan College.Follow J.

Hopes for the future were dashed.For Anna, 68, the crisis had particularly devastating consequences. Her husband, a retired bus driver, killed himself in a park two years ago at age 66 after a series of pension cuts deepened his despair.“He kept saying, ‘I’ve worked so many years. What will I have to show for it? How are we going to live?’” said Anna, who asked that her full name not be published to protect her family’s privacy. After two years of therapy, she now volunteers to help others struggling with mental health issues.Depression and suicide rates rose alarmingly during the Greek debt crisis, health experts and studies say, as the country’s creditors imposed strict austerity measures that cut wages, increased taxes and undermined the ability of health services to respond to a crisis within a crisis.“Mental health has deteriorated significantly in Greece, with depression being particularly widespread, as a result of the economic crisis,” Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, said in a November report. That has led to overcrowding at psychiatric hospitals and clinics and a 40 percent increase in suicides from 2010 to 2015, the report said.For those fighting the problems on the ground, the trend does not seem to be abating. The mental health organization Klimaka reported a 30 percent rise in calls to its suicide hotline last year, and a comparable rise in visits to its day center.“The financial crisis has increased people’s vulnerability to suicide,” said Kyriakos Katsadoros, Klimaka’s director. “Some even ask about euthanasia.”Suicide rates in Greece remain relatively low for Europe, with five suicides per 100,000 people compared with a regionwide average of 15.4, according to World Health Organization data for 2016, the most recent available. The rate of increase is high, however. It spiked from 3.3 per 100,000 to 5 between 2010 to 2016.The highest annual increase came in 2015, the year strikes and social upheaval reached a climax as Greece’s leftist-led government wrangled with the country’s international creditors over the terms of a third bailout.The suicide rate then dropped in 2016 and 2017, police figures show, only to rise again in the first 10 months of 2018, according to police figures that also show that suicides among those ages 22 and under more than doubled.Many suicides in Greece go unreported because of the Orthodox Church’s reluctance to provide burial services to those who take their own lives, although the church’s stance is changing, nongovernmental organizations say.The Greek Health Ministry set up a committee of mental health experts in November to prepare awareness campaigns, as well as plans to train general practitioners to better detect depression and other mental health issues. In the meantime, the health system’s struggles to address the problem are evident.At Evangelismos, one of the capital’s largest state hospitals, dozens of patients were being treated in the corridors of the psychiatric ward during a visit in April, “an unacceptable situation,” the Council of Europe’s anti-torture committee said in a report published in June.In the summer, the hospital’s workers’ union complained to a prosecutor that the clinic was accommodating twice the maximum capacity, with foldout beds set up in corridors and in doctors’ offices.“It’s like a stable,” said Dr. Ilias Sioras, president of the union, adding that people in all states — “catatonic and psychotic” — were being treated in the same space.Dromokaiteio Psychiatric Hospital in Athens is also overcrowded, with admissions up 12.3 percent in 2017 and staff members regularly staging strikes denouncing the conditions. And at Dafni, the Attica Psychiatric Hospital, which takes only very serious cases, “the impact of the economic crisis is reflected in the admissions,” said the director, Spiridoula Kalantzi, citing a 9.6 percent increase in 2017.The Council of Europe report noted that “unemployed persons, bankrupt businessmen, or parents who have no means of taking care of or feeding their children” were among new admissions to psychiatric units, most age 40 and older with no previous signs of mental illness.The Health Ministry ran a pilot program at hospitals in Athens last year aimed at ensuring all areas of the capital have at least one psychiatric hospital or clinic operating as a walk-in center at any given time, helping admissions to “stabilize” at Dafni and Dromokaiteio last year. Three new clinics opened in Greek hospitals in 2018, the ministry said, and there are plans for 16 more.In the meantime, much of the burden falls to Greece’s three main psychiatric hospitals — Dafni, Dromokaiteio, and the Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki — which in addition to providing health care fills the void left by cuts to social services.“Apart from the psychiatric cases, we have social cases, too,” said Dr. Nektarios Drakonakis of Dafni. “People come, they say, ‘I don’t have a home, I don’t have papers, I don’t have relatives, I don’t have anywhere to go.’”A 2016 law providing free access to health care for uninsured patients has been an invaluable safety net, said Ms. Kalantzi, the Dafni director.“When the delirium begins, many lose control of their finances, and then lose their insurance,” she said.But the spike in demand for psychological and psychiatric help coincided with dwindling staff levels and slashed budgets. Annual state spending on mental health was halved over 2011 and 2012, and it has been trimmed further each year since then. Austerity measures required hiring freezes, even as hundreds of workers retired.“I’m on my own, I don’t have anyone under me to help me,” said Dr. Christos Tsopelas at Dafni, adding that two doctors typically treat 35 to 40 patients, and that there was a severe shortage of nurses.A nurse at a halfway house died during a night shift recently, and 12 patients were alone until the morning, he said.Volunteers like Anna do their best to fill the gaps. Theodoros Megaloeconomou, a psychiatrist and former clinic director at Dafni, works at two centers in Athens, helping all sorts of people, many unemployed or in debt.“Many just come for the medication,” he said, noting that use of antidepressants had doubled since before the crisis.Even if the Greek government manages to address weaknesses in the health care system, health experts note that the main reasons behind the mental health crisis are very much alive.“As long as there is unemployment, insecurity and debt, the products of the financial crisis, this problem will not go away,” said Dr. Sioras, the union leader. “I fear it will get worse.”Mental health stigma must end, Prince William said on a panel at Davos. He also spoke of his own struggles with mental health and the British tradition of suppressing emotions.AdvertisementSupported byEl EspaceIt’s about planting seeds that will grow into understanding “whenever they’re ready.”By Concepción de LeónEl Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ¿Lo mejor? It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).Let me know if any of these sound familiar: Boys don’t cry. We don’t air family business. You have to be strong. Turn to God.These refrains (all of which I’ve heard at least once, some in the last month) are just some of the responses that people dealing with mental health challenges in Latino communities have come to know well. Going to therapy or struggling with mental illness can be viewed as a sign of weakness or that you’re “crazy.” Combine this with unequal access to mental health services and quality health insurance, and it’s no wonder that Latinos, who are just as likely to suffer from a mental illness as whites, are half as likely to seek treatment. When Adriana Alejandre, a therapist in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, started her practice in 2017, she tried to find accessible information for her predominantly Latino patients — the kind of resources that would apply directly to their lives. “I was super frustrated, because I couldn’t find any resources for my clients that were relevant, that were modern, that weren’t so much clinical jargon,” she said. So last year, she started a podcast to get the word out and help Latino patients see therapists as “more relatable.” Immediately she received dozens of responses asking for more information and, crucially, Spanish-language content. Alejandre started recording the episodes in Spanish as well as English. Now, Latinx Therapy is a full-fledged platform with a directory of therapists and free screening tests for depression, eating disorders and other common mental illnesses. At speaking engagements, Alejandre said, people still tell her things like “I’m not crazy,” or “That stuff is not for us, for our family. Our problems, we solve it ourselves.” She explained that Latino communities tend to be collectivist, meaning that we value the group over the individual, sometimes to personal detriment. In other words, if family members are resistant to therapy or talking about mental health struggles, “breaking that is tough,” Alejandre said. “The downfall is that people suffer in silence.”The mental health activist Dior Vargas, 31, was one of those people. “I didn’t talk about it with my family at all,” she said about her early struggles with anxiety and depression. “Everything really came to a head when I attempted to end my life when I was 18. That was an eye-opening experience for my family.”“We were all thrust into this really traumatic experience,” she added. Her family “went from having no knowledge to having a lot of knowledge.” One of the problems was that Vargas struggled with viewing her own experiences as valid. She grew up hearing about how many family members grew up poor in Ecuador, including her grandfather, who emigrated to the United States with only a third grade education. “There’s so much trauma he went through that he didn’t deal with, that he didn’t talk about,” she said. Hearing about her grandfather’s struggles made her think: “Who am I to talk about feeling depressed? Ain’t nobody got time for that.”But intergenerational trauma is a crucial reason for Latinos to go to therapy, said Alejandre. Not doing so “allows the cycle to continue — whether it’s trauma, whether it’s depression, anxiety, domestic violence,” she said.She suggests explaining therapy to family members by comparing it to other common treatments: “When we have a cough, we take cough syrup, jarabe, to feel better. When our minds are sick, we go to therapy.” She also said it’s important to clarify that therapy is not only for moments of crisis. “Therapy is a space where you can learn to build skills, whether that’s communication, whether that’s understanding yourself, creating boundaries.” For me, setting boundaries meant not telling anyone in my family that I was going to therapy for more than a year. It helped to have it be my own thing, to not have to answer to anyone or be questioned about what went on there. Vargas’s approach was to share “very general things so that they felt like they were part of it, but not to the extent that they knew too much, because that time between me and my therapist was my time.” Alejandre said: “It is tough when family sees you as ungrateful for healthy behaviors like boundary setting. But the system will not change if someone does not initiate the change.”And early conversations about therapy are like planting seeds in our communities, she added. Those seeds will grow into an understanding “whenever they’re ready.”Here are more stories to read this week. 📲 Check out our new Crossing the Border newsletter for (sometimes harrowing) stories about life on the U.S.-Mexico border.📺 Netflix is going to adapt “Cien Años de Soledad” into a series. 🎙 The former owner of La Marina, Fernando Mateo, went on “The Breakfast Club” to talk about the saga there.AdvertisementSupported byHigher levels of pollution were linked to a greater likelihood of psychotic experiences ranging from a mild feeling of paranoia to a severe psychotic symptoms. By Nicholas BakalarUrban air pollution is associated with an increased risk for psychotic experiences in teenagers, researchers report.A study published in JAMA Psychiatry included 2,063 British teenagers whose health had been followed from birth through age 18. Almost a third of them said they had at least one psychotic experience, ranging from a mild feeling of paranoia to a severe psychotic symptom, since age 12.Researchers linked air pollution data to locations where they spent most of their time — at home, school or work.Compared with teenagers who lived where pollution was lowest, those in the most polluted areas were 27 percent to 72 percent more likely to have psychotic experiences, depending on the type of pollutant; exposure to two pollutants, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides, accounted for 60 percent of the association.AdvertisementSupported byBy Brad WolvertonColleges are struggling to keep up with an increase in requests for mental health counseling. Many have hired additional staff members and are experimenting with new approaches to treatment.When Elizabeth Gong-Guy was named director of U.C.L.A.’s counseling and psychological services in 2005, the university was providing mental health services to less than 10 percent of its students. A decade later, when she moved into a different role, as executive director of U.C.L.A. campus and student resilience, more than 20 percent were under the university’s care.Seeing no end to the growth, U.C.L.A. became an early adopter of internet-based screenings and online mental health treatment. The university has also invested in “resilience peers” who are not licensed to provide counseling but who offer a release valve for stressed-out students.As part of a major research study, U.C.L.A. students can enroll in a six- to eight-week online program that teaches skills to combat anxiety and depression, working alongside a trained peer. The university’s goal: finding the most effective interventions for the largest number of students as quickly as possible.Nivi Ahlawat, a senior neuroscience major, tapped the university’s online resources to help her deal with an incident in her personal life. After using the program, she said she was encouraged to start a mindfulness practice and enroll in yoga and art classes to help reduce her anxiety. She has also served as a resilience peer, an experience that has influenced her career path.“This program fundamentally changed who I am and how I approach my life,” said Ms. Ahlawat, who plans to pursue graduate work in genetic counseling. “I may not remember the structures of all the intermediates of the glycolysis pathway I learned in biochemistry class. But I’ll remember what I’ve learned about active listening, motivational interviewing and mindfulness intervention for the rest of my life.”Kent State’s impetus to improve mental health services came from broad university mandates. The university, in Ohio, said it had added nine clinical staff positions across its eight campuses as part of a presidential push to emphasize student and staff mental health and wellness.The university has provided mental health training to more than 700 students, faculty and staff members, and created programs to help populations that do not traditionally seek counseling. Those efforts helped Kent State win a “healthy campus award ” last year from Active Minds, a national advocacy group that supports mental health awareness and education.Many students may not enjoy the benefits of therapy until they overcome more pressing obstacles, said Katy Troester-Trate, director of the health and wellness center at Jefferson Community College. The two-year institution in Watertown, N.Y., has many low-income and first-generation students, some of whom arrive on campus without basics like soap and toothpaste.“If you can’t afford groceries or safe care for your children, it’s hard to work on higher level things,” said Ms. Troester-Trate, a licensed social worker who keeps snacks in her desk for students.Her team has developed what she calls a “wraparound” model, providing an assortment of services outside of traditional talk therapy that help students address their overall well-being. Students can find many of those services at the college’s health and wellness center, which houses counseling offices alongside child-care assistance, a campus food pantry and more.Miranda Santos, a 24-year-old single parent, sought help there last year after failing a nursing class and having to repeat it during a semester-long weekend program. She received vouchers to help pay for child care and a food basket at Thanksgiving. She graduated last fall, with a job at an opioid-treatment clinic.AdvertisementSupported byBy Karen ZraickMost American teenagers — across demographic groups — see depression and anxiety as major problems among their peers, a new survey by the Pew Research Center found.The survey found that 70 percent of teenagers saw mental health as a big issue. Fewer teenagers cited bullying, drug addiction or gangs as major problems; those from low-income households were more likely to do so.The consistency of the responses about mental health issues across gender, race and income lines was striking, said Juliana Horowitz, an associate director of research at the center.The survey also asked respondents if they considered alcohol consumption or teen pregnancy to be major problems among their peers. Half of the teenagers from households earning less than $30,000 said alcohol was a major problem; that number decreased to 43 percent among teenagers in households earning more than $75,000.Teenagers diverged most drastically across income lines on the issue of teen pregnancy. Fifty-five percent of teenagers in lower-income households said it was a major problem among their peers. Just 22 percent of teenagers in wealthier households agreed.The survey of 920 teenagers ages 13 to 17 in the United States was conducted online and by phone in the fall. In their report, the researchers broke down results by income level and gender but not race or ethnicity, citing the small sample size.Some psychologists have tied a growth in mental health issues among teenagers to increased social media use, academic pressure and frightening events like terror attacks and school shootings.Teenagers who grew up in the post-9/11 era, and amid many school shootings, may have anxiety tied to an environment filled with dire warnings about safety, said Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia.His center often helps children distinguish between the possible and the probable, to help put anxiety about frightening but rare events in proper context.Another major stressor is constant surveillance by peers on social media, and the “fear of missing out” it can generate, he added. Again, he said, guidance about how to understand social media — for example, a person taking 50 photos to get one perfect image — can help to dispel anxiety.Increased rates of mental health issues could also be tied to better screening practices, noted Lynn Bufka, an associate executive director at the American Psychological Association.But it is still cause for concern, she said. Teenagers are dealing with rapid changes to their bodies, hormones and lives in an era of nonstop information overload, and they need help developing coping strategies.“It becomes really important for the adults around teens to be stable influences in their lives, to give them space for them to talk,” she said.A study released in 2017 found that the number of children and adolescents admitted to children’s hospitals for thoughts of self-harm or suicide had more than doubled from 2008 to 2015, echoing trends in federal data.Dr. Bufka said her top advice for adults worried about teenagers in their lives was simple: Listen, without “pouring on advice” or judging too much, and give them the opportunity to talk to a counselor or psychologist if needed.“Let them know that you’ve got their back,” she said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Reed AbelsonIn a scathing decision released Tuesday, a federal judge in Northern California ruled that a unit of UnitedHealth Group, the giant health insurer, had created internal policies aimed at effectively discriminating against patients with mental health and substance abuse disorders to save money.U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero found that United Behavioral Health, the insurer’s unit that administers treatments for mental illness and addiction in private health plans, had violated its fiduciary duty under federal law.In his 106-page decision, Judge Spero described the company’s guidelines as “unreasonable and an abuse of discretion” and having been “infected” by financial incentives meant to restrict access to care.“There is an excessive emphasis on addressing acute symptoms and stabilizing crises while ignoring the effective treatment of members’ underlying conditions,” he said. He dismissed much of the testimony by UnitedHealth’s experts as “evasive — and even deceptive.”Patients said they were denied care as soon as they appeared stable. One of the plaintiffs in the case said in a filing her son, who struggled with substance abuse, died after he was forced to leave a residential treatment facility when the insurer denied coverage.“In our view, it’s a monumental win for mental health and substance abuse patients,” said D. Brian Hufford, an attorney with Zuckerman Spaeder, who, along with Psych-Appeal, a private law firm specializing in insurance coverage for mental health issues, is representing the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are part of a class-action lawsuit against United Behavioral Health, and say they were covered under the United plans from 2011 to 2017 and denied care.In the aftermath of the ruling, the company maintained that it had not failed to provide the proper care.“We look forward to demonstrating in the next phase of this case how our members received appropriate care,” said UnitedHealth in an emailed statement. “We remain committed to providing our members with access to the right care for the treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders.”Judge Spero is expected to reach a final judgment in the next few months.The case represents the latest development in the contentious debate over how health insurance companies cover mental health and substance abuse disorders, as compared to medical conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis and asthma. In spite of the passage of a federal law, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, patients have long complained about the difficulty of getting care covered, especially when they are in no immediate danger.When the federal parity law prevented insurers from placing sharp limits on behavioral health coverage, the companies “came up with an even more insidious approach,” Mr. Hufford said, by developing internal rules that focused on providing expensive outpatient and residential care only when patients were acutely ill.Once the acute condition was treated, the companies would reduce or deny services, he said. The care “wasn’t addressing the underlying issue or the chronic condition,” he said.Advocates praised the judge’s decision as making clear that insurers cannot ignore standards that would be applied to other forms of medical care in determining whether they will cover a mental health or substance abuse treatment. “This should put health plans on notice that they simply can’t make up the rules as they go along,” said Angela Kimball, the national director of public policy and advocacy for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.Such denials of care are not limited to UnitedHealth, said Patrick Kennedy, the mental health advocate and former member of Congress who is pushing for stronger enforcement of federal and state parity laws. The judge’s ruling that UnitedHealth had not complied with the law is an “independent validation of what we have as advocates been saying for 11 years since this law was passed,” he said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Palko KaraszLONDON — Prince William, who has long spoken publicly about his emotional struggles, has taken his campaign for mental health awareness to Davos, Switzerland, urging global leaders to help break the stigma.Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, who is second in line to the British throne, spoke candidly on Wednesday about the difficulty he faced in trying to get celebrities to sign on to his cause, revealing — without naming names — that not one had initially offered to join the mental health campaign that he has run since 2016 with his wife and his brother.It was only once they went public with their Heads Together campaign and “people realized that Catherine, Harry and I put our necks on the line here,” he said, that well-known names began supporting the effort. Its advocates now include the actress Judi Dench.At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, Prince William interviewed David Attenborough, the film producer of nature programs and a respected voice on climate change, on Monday. But he also spoke of the silence about mental health that was common in his parents’ and grandparents’ generations, and he called for people to be more open about their emotions.The duke, whose grandmother Queen Elizabeth II trained as a driver and mechanic during World War II, said the war had been so devastating that many people who had lived through it decided that keeping quiet about the traumas was the best way to deal with them. In many cases that stoicism was passed down to their children and grandchildren.“You know, we all learn from our parents; we all learn from how they deal with things,” William said, adding that a whole generation had inherited the attitude that the way to deal with problems was not to talk about them.Now is the time to break that pattern, he added, saying: “We should talk about it, and we should get over it.”To hear a member of the British royal family publicly discuss personal struggles with mental health was once unthinkable. But in 2017, Prince William’s brother, Harry, opened up about the emotional struggle he faced after the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and about seeking counseling.“Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever — the Americans call them shrinks — someone you have never met before,” Harry said on a podcast in 2017.Prince William, who had encouraged his brother, now the Duke of Sussex, to seek help after struggling with their mother’s death, said he had also struggled with mental health, during the two years he served as an air ambulance pilot. “I was dealing with a lot of trauma on a day-in, day-out basis,” he said in Davos on Wednesday. “We are all embarrassed by emotions. British people particularly — we are very embarrassed about revealing our emotions.”Since 2008, the National Health Service has worked to extend the scope of talk therapy. The duke’s campaign has been credited with encouraging Britons to turn to the therapy for treatment.Still, recent statistics showed that antidepressants were the fastest-growing prescription drugs. In England, the number of antidepressants dispensed more than doubled from 2006 to 2016, to 64.7 million, according to NHS Digital. Critics of Prime Minister Theresa May’s government have said that funding cuts to some mental health services have cast doubt on its commitment to treat mental health on parity with physical health.Last year, the British government appointed a minister to deal with loneliness, which affects more than nine million people in the country.At Davos, Prince William appeared on the same panel as Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, who said that addressing mental health issues was a moral and economic imperative — one that affects productivity. She urged the business world to take on the issue.To Ms. Ardern, whose progressive politics have drawn international attention, it was also a personal one, as she leads a country dealing with high depression and suicide rates. “I’ve lost friends, and I wouldn’t have to look far in my cabinet to find others who have as well,” she said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Des ShoeThis is the final edition of The Week in Good News.

Read more »AdvertisementSupported byBy Sarah MervoshTwo former sheriff’s deputies in South Carolina were charged on Friday in the deaths of two mental health patients who became trapped in a van and drowned during Hurricane Florence.The deputy who was driving the van, Stephen Flood, 66, was charged with two counts of reckless homicide and two counts of involuntary manslaughter after the authorities said he disregarded travel instructions and drove into floodwaters.The officer who accompanied him, Joshua Bishop, 29, was accused of failing to prevent Mr. Flood from driving into the flood and was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.Both men posted bond and were released on Friday. If convicted, they could serve time in prison. The range of punishment for reckless homicide includes up to 10 years behind bars; for involuntary manslaughter, it is up to five years.The deputies, from the Horry County Sheriff’s Office, had been told to safely transport the patients to a mental health center in September, as Hurricane Florence drenched the Carolinas. They were not being evacuated from the floodwaters, but being moved from hospitals for further treatment.One of the patients, Nicolette Green, 43, had schizophrenia and had been committed on the recommendation of her counselor. The other, Wendy Newton, 45, had asked to be taken to a hospital because she thought she was about to have a “spell.” Both women sought out treatment, hoping to feel better, their families said.Law enforcement officers were assigned to drive them to the mental health center, as is routine under state law. As water levels rose and roads shut down, Mr. Flood and Mr. Bishop “were provided a travel route that was believed to be safe,” a probable cause affidavit said.But the deputies did not take the path recommended by their supervisors, according to the affidavit. Instead, the authorities said, they took an alternate route, passing through a barricade and driving into floodwaters on Highway 76 in Marion County in northeastern South Carolina.The van stalled out in the flooding, the affidavit said, and was swept into a guardrail.One of the deputies, Mr. Bishop, managed to escape, but Ms. Newton and Ms. Green were trapped in a cage in the back of the van. Mr. Bishop tried and failed to rescue them multiple times, according to the affidavit.He eventually managed to extract Mr. Flood, the driver, from the van, the affidavit said. But by the time emergency workers arrived by boat and found the deputies on the van’s roof, it was too dark to dive.The van, with Ms. Green and Ms. Newton inside, remained in the floodwaters overnight. Their bodies were recovered the next day.“Why would they chain her and another lady to the back of a truck?” Ms. Newton’s daughter, Allison, asked afterward. “Why didn’t they tell us she was being transported? Why were they going through floodwaters knowing how dangerous it’s been?”Mr. Flood, who had been on the force for 10 years, and Mr. Bishop, who had been on the force for six years, were fired in October.Allie Argoe, a lawyer for Mr. Flood, said in Marion County Magistrate Court on Friday that “he never had any intention to ever hurt those women.” Bert von Herrmann, who represents Mr. Bishop, called the case a “tragic accident” but said his client was a passenger who did everything he could to try to save the patients.Ms. Green’s daughter Rose, who is a senior in high school, told the court that her mother will not be here to help her shop for a prom dress or to attend her high school graduation.Ms. Green’s family members said they were haunted by her final moments, trapped in a cage as the water flooded into the van. “Nothing can fix the pain I feel,” Rose said. “Every night is just a constant lack of sleep.”“All I see is my mother,” she added, “and I hear her screams and her cries.”Follow Sarah Mervosh on Twitter: @smervosh. AdvertisementSupported byThe task force of experts recommended at-risk women seek certain types of counseling, and it cited two specific programs that have been particularly effective.By Pam BelluckAs many as one in seven women experience depression during pregnancy or in the year after giving birth. Now, for the first time, a national panel of health experts says there is a way to prevent it.Some kinds of counseling can keep some women from developing debilitating symptoms that can harm not only them but their babies, the panel reported on Tuesday. Its report amounted to a public call for health providers to seek out women with certain risk factors and guide them to counseling programs. The recommendation, by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, means that insurers will be required to cover those services — with no co-payments — under the Affordable Care Act.“We really need to find these women before they get depressed,” said Karina Davidson, a task force member and senior vice president for research for Northwell Health. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Perinatal depression, as it is called, is estimated to affect between 180,000 and 800,000 American mothers each year and up to 13 percent of women worldwide. The condition increases a woman’s risk of becoming suicidal or harming her infant, the panel reported. It also increases the likelihood that babies will be born premature or have low birth weight, and can impair a mother’s ability to bond with or care for her child. The panel reported that children of mothers who had perinatal depression have more behavior problems, cognitive difficulties and mental illness.The panel emphasized that perinatal depression is shouldn’t be confused with “baby blues” — the tears, irritability, fatigue, and anxiety that many women experience after delivery but which evaporates within 10 days.The panel evaluated research on numerous possible prevention methods, including physical activity, education, infant sleep advice, yoga, expressive writing, omega-3 fatty acids and antidepressants. Several showed some promise, including physical activity and programs in Britain and the Netherlands involving home visits by midwives or other providers. But  only counseling demonstrated enough scientific evidence of benefit.Women receiving one of two forms of counseling were 39 percent less likely than those who didn’t to develop perinatal depression. One approach involved cognitive behavioral therapy, helping women navigate their feelings and expectations to create healthy, supportive environments for their children. The other involved interpersonal therapy, including coping skills and role-playing exercises to help manage stress and relationship conflicts.“This recommendation is really important,” said Jennifer Felder, an assistant professor of psychiatry at University of California, San Francisco, who was not on the panel. “This focuses on identifying women who are at risk for depression and proactively preventing its onset, using concrete guidelines.”The panel recommended counseling for women with one or more of a broad range of risk factors, including a personal or family history of depression; recent stresses like divorce or economic strain; traumatic experiences like domestic violence; or depressive symptoms that don’t constitute a full-blown diagnosis. Others include being a single mother, a teenager, low-income, lacking a high school diploma, or having an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, panel members said.It highlighted two specific programs, which were similarly successful, Dr. Davidson said. They counsel first-time mothers and those who already have children. They are available in Spanish and focus on low-income women, about 30 percent of whom develop perinatal depression, experts say.One program, “Mothers and Babies,” includes cognitive behavioral therapy in eight to 17 group sessions, often delivered in clinics or community health centers, primarily during pregnancy with at least two sessions postpartum.“It’s really meant to break down this idea that talking about your thoughts and behaviors is scary,” said Darius Tandon, an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and principal investigator of several “Mothers and Babies” studies.  So far, health and human service agencies in over 175 counties in 21 states have been trained to implement the program. It is also being evaluated in Florida and the Midwest to see if it works when administered one-on-one by home visiting caseworkers instead of groups run by psychologists or social workers, Dr. Tandon said.The other program, “Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for New Moms” or ROSE, typically delivered in four sessions during pregnancy and one postpartum, can be administered in groups or one-on-one by nurses, midwives or anyone trained to follow the manual, said Jennifer Johnson, a professor of public health at Michigan State University.So far, women in Rhode Island, Mississippi and Japan have participated, said ROSE’s creator, Caron Zlotnick, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University. She and Dr. Johnson are testing its expansion to 90 clinics throughout the country.Karla Manica, 30, a single mother of four in Detroit, participated in “Mothers and Babies” when pregnant with her youngest, who is now 1. She said she experienced abuse as a child and in relationships, attempted suicide by drinking cleaner, lived in homeless shelters after being laid off from her job as a dementia caregiver, and has had bipolar depression.“It was good to come to the table and share,” Ms. Manica said. The counselor texted uplifting messages between sessions, and “homework assignments” to engage in stress-relieving activities were useful. When Ms. Manica learned her baby’s father had another girlfriend, she said, the group “gave me hope.”After her daughter Kathryn was born, “I was well,” Ms. Manica said. “If I hadn’t got with the Mothers and Babies, would I have been prepared, would I have gotten the confidence I have now? No.”Experts and leaders of the programs, whose curriculums and counselor training are free, said financial and other obstacles exist.“Cost is definitely still an issue,” said Dr. Tandon. He said one prenatal session costs clinics delivering the counseling $40 to $50 to provide mothers’ transportation and child care, and Medicaid doesn’t have a reimbursement code for preventive counseling, so clinics often absorb the cost of staff time to provide it.Access to counseling also can be difficult. “Especially when you’re pregnant and you have competing demands on your time and energy, or if you have a little one at home,” said Dr. Felder, who wrote an editorial about the recommendation. Offering it online or through apps may help.Even in some cases in which it doesn’t prevent depression, counseling may be beneficial, said Dr. Melissa Simon, a task force member and vice chairwoman of research at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine’s obstetrics and gynecology department. “It provides the pregnant person with education and coping strategies,” she said, and can encourage those who develop depression to seek treatment faster.Captoria Porter, 28, of Bolingbrook, Ill., who has seven children, ages 2 months to 11, experienced no depression during or after her first five pregnancies. But during her sixth, life became more tumultuous, with marital problems and the need to move in with her sister because the housing project where she was living was closing.After the birth of Myla, now 1, “I think I had symptoms of depression,” said Ms. Porter, who has worked as a telemarketer selling sanitizer dispensers. “I was really sad.”Fortunately, the pre-birth “Mothers and Babies” sessions helped her recognize signs like “you don’t want to brush your hair or you don’t want to be bothered with the baby,” she said. “I would find myself feeling that way.”Ms. Porter met twice with a community center counselor, but realized the program had already taught her the practices he recommended: “Reaching out to family and friends. Learning that I can’t control everything. Eating when the baby eats, sleeping when the baby sleeps, laying the kids down for a nap and calling it ‘me time.’”That warded off full-blown depression. “I caught it early,” she said.The panel encouraged more research on all prevention approaches. In reviewing 50 studies of various methods, it found negative effects only in the two small studies with antidepressants. One study reported instances of dizziness and drowsiness among women who took Zoloft. The other reported that more women taking Pamelor experienced constipation.“Some people have asked, ‘Why aren’t you just recommending antidepressants?’” Dr. Davidson said. “Of course, antidepressants were developed and studied for someone who has depression. We need to consider possible benefits and possible harms to parent and fetus when someone is not depressed and you’re giving them a drug to treat depression on the off-chance it prevents depression.”Beth Sanfratel, 43, a preschool teacher in Birmingham, Ala., said she wished she’d had a counseling program when pregnant with the second of three sons, Mac, now 10.“I don’t even think postpartum depression was mentioned,” she said. Several months after Mac was born, Ms. Sanfratel, usually upbeat and social, said she began having crying spells. “I was having trouble getting up and in general just being really bummed out.”Ultimately, Ms. Sanfratel, a former social worker, recognized she needed help and took antidepressants for about a year, resuming them shortly before her third son, Beau, was born in 2011.AdvertisementSupported byBy Laura ParkerIn the coming adventure video game Sea of Solitude, the main character — a young woman named Kay — navigates a partly submerged city as she faces a multitude of red-eyed scaly creatures.None are as terrifying as her own personal demons. As the game progresses, Kay realizes the creatures she is encountering are humans who turned into monsters when they became too lonely. To save herself, she fights to overcome her own loneliness.Kay was modeled after the game’s creative director, Cornelia Geppert of Jo-Mei Games, an independent game studio, who struggled after a 2013 breakup. “I felt like I was trapped in a cage,” Ms. Geppert, 37, said of her experience.Sea of Solitude, which Electronic Arts will publish this year, is among a growing number of video games that are tackling mental health issues.Last year, a game called Celeste explored depression and anxiety through a protagonist who had to avoid physical and emotional obstacles. In 2017’s fantasy action-adventure video game Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, a young Celtic warrior deals with psychosis.Other games in recent years, including Night in the Woods and Pry, have delved into self-identity, anger issues and post-traumatic stress disorder. All followed the 2013 interactive fiction game Depression Quest, which asked players to step into the shoes of a character living with depression.These games are a far cry from the industry’s better-known story lines of battlefield heroics or the zombie apocalypse. But as a cultural conversation around mental health grows louder, makers of content are responding. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, one in five American adults lives with a mental illness.“Mental health is becoming a more central narrative in our culture, with greater efforts to normalize mental health challenges,” said Eve Crevoshay, executive director of Take This, a nonprofit that educates video game developers on best practices around portraying mental health. “With that trend comes response from creative industries, including games.” (Take This was founded in 2013 after the suicide of a video game journalist prompted a debate about the issue.)To date, most of the games tackling mental health have come from independent makers, which are typically more willing and able to take risks by exploring unusual subject matter. Sea of Solitude points to a shift: a gamble by Electronic Arts, one of the industry’s largest publishers and better known for its Madden football and Battlefield war games, to invest in the topic.“We were immediately captivated by Connie’s passion and artistic vision for Sea of Solitude, which is unique, beautifully realized and made more powerful by being an important one,” said Rob Letts, general manager of EA Originals, the label focused on publishing independent games.Some in the industry said the interactive nature of games made them more effective than film or television at dealing with mental health. Embodying a video game character who suffers from depression might leave a deeper impression of the challenges of the illness than simply watching a film about the same character, for example.Video games can be “a more effective way of bouncing back from negative moods than passive forms of media like TV or movies,” said Raffael Boccamazzo, a mental health practitioner in Seattle who works with Take This.That was what Sam Rodriguez, 26, experienced after playing one of these video games, Night in the Woods. Ms. Rodriguez, a freelance writer in Atlanta, said a diagnosis of bipolar disorder last year had left her feeling isolated and lost.But she said she felt a connection to the protagonist of Night in the Woods, Mae, a college dropout who returns to her hometown but struggles to reconnect with family and friends. Ms. Rodriguez’s first play-through of the game was extremely emotional, she said, because “I was able to experience the world through the eyes of someone like me, who felt helpless and aimless in life.” She added that she felt especially drawn to Mae’s use of sarcasm to deflect and bury her own problems.While Ms. Rodriguez was already in treatment, she said, the game motivates her to be more honest and receptive with her therapist. She has since become an ambassador in a Take This program, in which she regularly discusses mental health on her social media channels and on the live-streaming platform Twitch.Makers of mental health games said they had seen a similar reaction from other players. After the 2016 simulation role-playing game Stardew Valley — which does not punish players for not completing tasks and creates a slow-paced atmosphere where the objective is to take care of a run-down farm — was released, Eric Barone, the game’s creator, received hundreds of messages, he said. Players wrote to share their stories of how the game helped them cope with difficult periods in their lives.“One story that comes to mind is a person whose little brother had autism, and as a result had great difficulty in relating with him,” said Mr. Barone, 31. “But playing Stardew Valley caused him to open up and allowed the two brothers to bond in a way that was never possible before.”Some makers are now developing games to explicitly promote better mental health. Orpheus Self Care Entertainment, a start-up that was founded last year, is publishing virtual reality games in which players practice mindfulness and meditation through activities like dancing. In one game, players move their bodies in virtual reality to create patterns and shapes that move and change color.IThrive Games Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to improve mental health in teenagers through games and education, is also working on a new mobile game for teenagers who suffer from anxiety. The nonprofit is experimenting with a few different game styles — from role-playing to choose-your-own-adventure — for it. IThrive hopes to test the game by next year.“Asking someone to play with you sets a very different vibe than asking someone to talk about their problems,” said Kelli Dunlap, iThrive’s director of mental health research.Ms. Crevoshay of Take This said the games industry was at a tipping point in how it accepted and embraced mental health challenges. She said she wanted to see more mainstream developers tackle the topic and more support for gamers who spoke out about these challenges.“We know these are not easy changes to make,” she said. “But we want to try.”An earlier version of this article misstated the position of Raffael Boccamazzo, who is a mental health practitioner, not a clinical psychologist.Follow Laura Parker on Twitter: @lauraannaparker.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressDALLAS — Sawyer Letcher heard voices others couldn't. They told him to hurt himself.Trying to silence the clamor in his head, the 19-year-old would bang it against a prison wall in Texas until he bled. He tried to hang himself at least twice before eventually taking his life with bed sheets in his cell in May 2017.His attempts at suicide were warnings that prison staff neglected to address, according to a lawsuit filed by Letcher's mother, Keri Womack, against the state prison system and its public health care provider.Her attorney, Scott Medlock, said Letcher's death is reflective of a systemic issue plaguing Texas prisons, which he calls ill-equipped to protect people with mental illness. He said the environment is "kind of a powder keg for suicide attempts.""The big-picture problem is there are not enough in-patient beds to accommodate all the people" in the system who have severe mental illness, Medlock said.Suicides in Texas prisons hit a 10-year high of 40 in 2018, and a steady rise in suicide attempts in these state-run facilities alarms prisoner rights advocates. The number of suicide attempts among Texas inmates logged by authorities has nearly tripled in the last decade, climbing from less than 700 in 2009 to nearly 2,000 in 2018 even as the number of people imprisoned in the state has fallen by 10,000, according to documents The Associated Press obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice last month through a public records request.Prisoner rights advocates say the rise supports their argument that the prisons in one of America's most heavily incarcerated states need more outside oversight. Corrections staff and some elected leaders, however, suggest the increase can be attributed to prison workers being more focused on monitoring a growing number of inmates with serious mental health needs. The officials say the state's prisons also have changed what they define as a suicide attempt, leading to more attempts being counted.The Department of Criminal Justice likely "overcounts" suicide attempts as it focuses on preventing actual suicides, said spokesman Jeremy Desel, who declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by Letcher's mother.In 2013, Texas started including in its attempted-suicide tally people who say they intend to take their own lives, Desel said. Last year, 88% of attempted suicides among Texas inmates did not involve any injuries and less than 2% required life-saving measures, he said.The increase in suicide attempts parallels a rise in Texas prisoners being diagnosed with mental health conditions, despite the overall prison population being on a decline. This is part of a national trend in which people behind bars increasingly have serious mental health needs that can exceed the training of corrections officers, experts say."Prisons and jails have become the de facto mental health institutions in our country, and their mission is not to address mental health issues. Their mission is to keep people locked up," said Dr. Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine at Brown University and director of The Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, both in Providence, Rhode Island.At the end of 2018, more than 19% of Texas' nearly 148,000 prisoners required mental health care, compared with nearly 14% in 2009 when the state's prisons held about 158,000 inmates, according to the Department of Criminal Justice.Prisons in Alabama, another state with a high incarceration rate, also have seen suicides — and suicide attempts logged by authorities — increase in recent years as prison staffs have been unable to address inmates' mental health needs. In 2017, a federal judge ruled that Alabama has provided "horrendously inadequate" care to mentally ill inmates and ordered changes, and the same judge is now weighing whether to force the state to take action after 15 inmate suicides in 15 months.A Department of Justice report earlier this month said Alabama's suicides occurred in the nation's deadliest prisons where male inmates are housed in unconstitutional conditions. The report also cast doubt on how state officials classify some prisoner deaths."Prison systems are overwhelmed with the numbers of people with serious mental illness that they need to respond to," said Ronald Honberg, a senior policy adviser with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. "Oftentimes the staff don't have the training to really respond, and oftentimes the response is punitive."Letcher became a prisoner in Rusk, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) southeast of Dallas, after being convicted of assaulting a public servant. His mother's lawyer, Medlock, said the prison's "depressing and awful atmosphere" agitated Letcher. Guards found him hanging from his bed sheets twice in the 18 months before he killed himself, and medical staff had repeatedly told the prison not to allow Letcher to have materials he could use to take his own life, the lawsuit said.Texas lawmakers have debated about whether to establish independent prison oversight. Supporters of the approach say the rise in suicide attempts needs closer monitoring and further investigation. Others say the increase shows prison officials are responding to legislative oversight.Republican state Rep. James White, chair of the House corrections committee, said Texas prisons changing what they define as a suicide attempt is in reaction to legislative action. As a result, he said, the Department of Criminal Justice is producing "more robust and transparent reporting" on suicide attempts.Other changes have occurred, too. In 2015, the department increased the training people get before starting work at a prison from 216 to 240 hours, with most of the added time focused on mental health and crisis intervention, Desel, the department spokesman, said.Those who support having someone outside the prison system do oversight say it would complement legislative oversight and bring even more transparency.Jennifer Erschabek, executive director of the Texas Inmate Families Association, said the hope is that independent oversight would help prisons better determine who is attempting suicide and why, and get inmates the care they need.AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders discuss an essay that called for “alarmism and catastrophic thinking.”To the Editor:Re “Time to Panic,” by David Wallace-Wells (Sunday Review, Feb. 17):As a co-editor of the 1989 Environmental Protection Agency Report to Congress on climate change effects on America and an author of three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and National Climate Assessments, I can assure you that these assessments have not played down the risks of climate change; there is little incentive to exclude scientific information on risk. Report authors focus on getting it right — making sure that the science supports our findings on potential risks (and benefits) from climate change. Our drafts are subject to extensive review. Report authors often disagreed about how to interpret the science, but I did not witness deliberate downplaying or burying of information on risks from climate change.Beyond this, the article’s call for “panic” is disturbing. We need a major effort to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This requires boldness, but also rational analysis and leadership, not panic. Panic leads to irrationality, finger-pointing and often tragedy. Let’s keep our heads on.Joel B. SmithBoulder, Colo.To the Editor:A number of concerned psychiatrists from all over the country have recognized the points raised by David Wallace-Wells. We formed an organization, the Climate Psychiatry Alliance, explicitly focused on raising awareness of the mental health effects of climate disruption.

The government said the study, which will run until 2021, is one of the largest of its kind in the world.“As a society, we are much more open about our mental health than ever before, but the modern world has brought new pressures for children,” Damian Hinds, the British education secretary, said in a statement.“Children will start to be introduced gradually to issues around mental health, well-being and happiness right from the start of primary school,” he added.The initiative comes months after a survey commissioned by the National Health Service found that one in eight children in England between the ages of 5 and 19 suffered from at least one mental disorder at the time of their assessment in 2017.The survey, which was published in November, also indicated a slight increase in mental disorders in five to 15-year-olds, which rose to 11.2 percent in 2017 from 9.7 percent in 1999. Disorders like anxiety and depression were the most common, affecting one in 12 children and early adolescents in 2017, and appeared more often in girls.Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns for Action for Children, a British charity, in the United Kingdom, called it a “children’s mental health crisis.”“Every day our front-line services see children and teenagers struggling to get to grips with how they fit into the increasingly complex modern world — contending with things like intense pressure at school, bullying or problems at home, all while being bombarded by social media,” he said in a statement on Monday.He added: “Services like these can lessen the anxiety, pain and anguish that some teens go through, but also reduce their need for intensive support further down the line.”But two Parliamentary committees have criticized the government reports on which the program is based, for focusing on handling emotional problems rather than preventing them. In a report released last May, the Education and Health and Social Care Committees wrote, “the Government’s strategy lacks ambition and will provide no help to the majority of those children who desperately need it,” while increasing the workload of teachers.“The role of prevention appears to be a missing link in building better support for children and young people, especially in the early years,” the committees wrote. They found that social media and the schools’ system of high-pressure exams can have particularly negative effects on the mental health of young people.But Dr. Jessica Deighton, an associate professor in child mental health and well-being at University College London who is leading the government trials, said that the new initiative was intended to offer more than quick fixes.“There is a tendency to think that the solution is mental health intervention,” she said on Monday. “We will try to reduce the stigma against mental health problems, by making the school environment literate in mental health.”She said the program included several tactics, including training teachers to hold role-playing exercises, teaching relaxation practices and inviting professionals for group discussions.“It’s not just to make them feel better in the short-term,” Dr. Deighton said, “but to better equip them for later in life.”AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionBy Natalie ProulxHave you ever tried mindfulness or meditation, practices that focus on the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations?

A relatively new program, known as the Mayor’s Challenge, that helps city and state governments reach more veterans through more public health programs via Veterans Affairs partnerships has shown some promise, but no data exists yet demonstrating suicide reductions.While the V.A. has been the public face of the issue, veterans are in many ways an amplification of the same factors that drive suicide in the broader American population: a fragmented health care system, a shortage of mental health resources, especially in rural areas, a lack of funding for suicide research and easy access to guns. All of these contribute to the drastically increased suicide rate among all Americans, which rose 33 percent from 1999 to 2017.High rates of homelessness, traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress and a military culture that can be resistant to seeking help are all aggravating factors for veterans, whose rates of suicide have been the subject of numerous hearings on Capitol Hill.“We are not even at the Sputnik stage of understanding problems with mental health,” said Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs. “I have said this is the No. 1 clinical priority that is made manifest by the president putting V.A. as the lead for this national task force.”Some programs to address veteran suicide are showing promise.A study of nine V.A. emergency rooms found 45 percent fewer suicidal behaviors among patients who received follow-up outreach after suicide attempts; as a result of this study, all V.A. medical centers have put into place the Safety Planning Intervention program.Since the department in 2017 began tracking suicides at Veterans Affairs facilities — among the most high-profile of veteran suicides — there have been more than 260 suicide attempts, 240 of which have been interrupted, department officials say.Yet about 70 percent of veterans do not regularly use the V.A., access to a federal department that may be viewed as central to suicide prevention.“The vast majority of veterans that die by suicide are not seeking services,” said Julie Cerel, a professor at the University of Kentucky and president of the American Association of Suicidology. “So the V.A.s are kind of at a loss of how to serve this group of people. Yet when they do end their lives, it becomes the responsibility of the V.A.,” in the viewpoint of critics, she said.Leadership turmoil — a consistent trait of the Trump administration — has complicated the V.A.’s attempt to address suicide. The agency’s director of its prevention office, Caitlin Thompson, resigned in 2017 after tangling with political appointees. According to a Government Accountability Office report last year, the office has essentially languished. Most notably, the office spent $57,000 of its $6.2 million media budget, and its presence on social media declined 77 percent from the levels of 2015, the report found. Lawmakers expressed outrage.Although Veterans Affairs officials blamed miscommunication at the time, Keita Franklin, the department’s new executive director of suicide prevention, said that the program had been delayed to come up with a more targeted marketing campaign, called #BeThere. It will try to “talk more specifically with targeted audiences,” she said, noting campaigns focused on 18- to 24-year-olds might focus on texting a friend in trouble while the over-60 crowd would be encouraged to have coffee. Some advertisements would be honed for women, for example, or for veterans in rural communities.Yet myriad political, structural and cultural impediments exist far beyond the administration’s walls.Many suicide experts believe that a lack of proper training in suicide prevention in the broader mental health field, hobbled by a lack of research into a matter that has stymied so many public health officials, is central to the issue.In 2017, the suicide rate in the United States reached 14 per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; it is the nation’s 10th leading cause of death. Yet only $68 million is expected to be spent on suicide research this year, according to the National Institutes of Health. In comparison, breast cancer will receive about $709 million in research funding and $243 million is expected to be spent this year researching prostate cancer.“There has been tremendous research on breast cancer and AIDS, which lowered mortality rates on diseases we once thought once insurmountable,” Dr. Cerel said. “However, we have not had comparable research into suicide.”Guns are used in the majority of veteran suicides, in large part because gun ownership is high for that group. Last year, about 80 percent of suicides among veterans in Montana were by firearms, said Claire R. Oakley, the director of health promotion at RiverStone Health, a community provider attached to the Mayor’s Challenge in Billings, Mont., which has had among the highest rates of suicide in the nation.“Awareness is important but it does take funding and there is no capacity funding to do this work,” she said, noting that volunteers had filled many of the gaps.Proper storage techniques and training friends and family to know when to try to remove guns from vulnerable veterans are still lacking. Lawmakers who move to reduce gun access to suicidal veterans often face resistance.“By reducing access to firearms you see a drop right away,” said Jane Pearson, chairwoman of the Suicide Research Consortium at the National Institute of Mental Health. “We have to think of a way forward that is fair, that does not take away weapons unfairly.”Several states have enacted “extreme risk protection order” laws, which help law enforcement and family members temporarily remove guns from, or prohibit their purchases by, people who may be a threat to themselves.Perhaps most vexing is a military culture that emphasizes discipline and perseverance, which can backfire when a veteran is suicidal.“People who join the military have this sense of boot straps, ‘I can do it,’” Dr. Franklin said. “Then you become a vet and they say come in and get mental health care, and inwardly they don’t feel good doing it.”Mr. Trump’s executive order would also task multiple federal agencies — like the Agriculture Department in rural areas — to pitch in on veteran suicide prevention and to give grants to local governments to work with health care partners to better reach veterans.“There is no single cause of suicide,” Dr. Franklin said. “When we pull a thread, we see a complex situation with 25 factors playing. We can’t prevent suicide from where we sit in the V.A. by ourselves.”Allowing local governments to join with health care providers has also shown promise. The Massachusetts Coalition for Suicide Prevention, for instance, works through 10 regional coalitions to provide veterans with mental health services as well as things like entrepreneurship training.A major complication is reaching the veterans to start. Many use both V.A. and community providers; providers outside the system have varied forms of insurance coverage.“There are a lot of things the V.A. have done right,” Dr. Pearson said. “The issue is the challenge in our health care system with people jumping from one system to another.”The Mayor’s and Governor’s Challenges — which team governments with community health care providers to better reach and service veterans — show promise in connecting veterans to needed services inside and outside the Department of Veterans Affairs.Brent Arnspiger, the suicide prevention coordinator for the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center in Houston, works with a local provider to send veterans who are not eligible for V.A. services to that provider’s facilities, and vice versa. “We have a warm handoff instead of just giving someone a phone number,” he said. “In the last three months, we have given 30 consults there,” he said of the health centers, “and they brought five to us.”Other states are eagerly embracing the same challenge. “The Commonwealth of Virginia has one of the largest populations of veterans, service members and their families in the nation,” said Carlos Hopkins, the Virginia secretary of Veterans and Defense Affairs, “which gives us a particularly keen awareness of the importance of tackling this national epidemic head on.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Brad WolvertonThe email set off alarms at Ithaca College.“I’m literally fighting for my life but staying safe,” 22-year-old Christopher Biehn emailed a professor in late September. “I won’t be in class today (or perhaps for a bit) & just pray I won’t be hospitalized long-term.”As Mr. Biehn prepared to check into a psychiatric ward four hours from campus, a crisis team from the private liberal arts college in central New York swung into action. Shortly after Mr. Biehn wrote to his professor, a campus safety officer went to his apartment to make sure he was O.K. A social worker from the college reached out to discuss academic options as he worked to manage his bipolar disorder.Two weeks later, after returning to his home in Medford, N.J., for treatment, he applied for a medical leave of absence from the college — his sixth leave in four years.In extensive interviews, Mr. Biehn recounted his experiences. He has also written about them in a blog and in Ithaca College’s student paper. He started a grass-roots social media campaign to promote acceptance for mood disorders, inspired to share his story in hopes of helping others.His journey illustrates the intense struggles students can face and the increasing steps colleges are taking to manage what some experts are calling a mental health crisis on campus. (Ithaca officials said they could not discuss a student’s health records, citing federal privacy laws.)Students and institutions are grappling with issues like the surge in school shootings and trauma from suicides and sexual assault. But it’s not just the crises that have shaken this generation — it’s the grinding, everyday stresses, from social media pressures to relationship problems to increased academic expectations.More than 60 percent of college students said they had experienced “overwhelming anxiety” in the past year, according to a 2018 report from the American College Health Association. Over 40 percent said they felt so depressed they had difficulty functioning.Money problems are exacerbating their worries. Mental health professionals say college students have experienced financial burdens on a different scale than many of their predecessors. They grew up during the Great Recession and have seen family members lose jobs and homes. They have great uncertainty about their career prospects and feel pressure to excel academically or risk losing job opportunities.“There’s a much more radical feeling that you’re either a winner or a loser,” said Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist and medical director of the Jed Foundation, which helps colleges improve their mental health programming. “That’s put tremendous pressure on college students and is feeding a lot of the anxiety we’re seeing.”As students have encountered more mental health problems, they have sought help in record numbers. Between the fall of 2009 and spring of 2015, the number of students who visited campus counseling centers increased by more than 30 percent, while college enrollment climbed just 5 percent, according to a 2015 report by the Center for Collegiate Mental Health.People of all ages, but young adults in particular, are increasingly comfortable sharing intimate details of their mental health conditions, right down to their dose of antidepressant. Many expect their colleges to help them cope.“You want a college that treats you for the person you are and gives you the help you deserve,” said Katia Seitz, a 19-year-old high school senior from Houston, who has received treatment for an eating disorder. “You don’t want a college that shuts you off or feels like it’s not their responsibility to take care of you.”Several admissions officials say they have seen a rise in inquiries regarding counseling and mental health services and accommodations from parents and prospective students.Colleges have helped drive demand for mental health services, pouring money into education and training to help students identify problems and learn where to turn for help. But critics say many colleges have not adequately prepared for the increasing demand, leaving some students frustrated.Nationwide, students typically have to wait almost seven business days for their first appointment with a college counselor, according to a 2017 report from the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors. But at some colleges, it can be more than two months.Three years ago, the counseling center at Queens College had 60 students on its waiting list (it does not require anyone experiencing a crisis to wait). Like many institutions, it began restricting the number of times students could see a counselor, from unlimited visits to 12. At the start of this semester, its waiting list was down to 30 students. But wait times can grow during peak periods.“As we approach midterms, it feels like we’re running a crisis clinic rather than a counseling center,” said Barbara Moore, director of counseling, health and wellness. She would like to add more counselors, but doesn’t have the space.Many colleges, however, are increasing their ranks. At least 155 counseling centers added new clinical positions from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, according to the report by the association for counseling center directors.Studies show that hiring additional therapists can help keep students healthy and enrolled, which can be a good return on investment for an institution.“If your tuition is $50,000 a year and your counseling budget is $1 million, your counseling center doesn’t have to retain that many students to make up that cost,” said Greg Eells, director of counseling and psychological services at Cornell University.A recent independent review of Ithaca College’s student health and psychological services center, which found gaps in senior leadership and access to care, prompted the college to create a senior-level position responsible for student wellness and to make other improvements. Since 2017, the college has added two positions to both its counseling and case-management staffs.[Read more about what some schools have done to address students’ mental health.]The 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, which prompted universities to change how they deal with mental health issues, led many institutions to hire case managers, or “ICare” teams, like Ithaca’s, whose jobs include helping students in distress. Just 25 people attended the inaugural meeting of the Higher Education Case Managers Association, in 2008, the group said. By the end of this year, the association expects to have more than 900 members.And although colleges have increased the size of their counseling staffs, many campuses are still straining to keep up, forcing some institutions to rethink their treatment strategies.Daniel Eisenberg, a University of Michigan professor, said many colleges were also intrigued with the idea of online treatment, but were skeptical of its merits.“One of the best parts of campuses is that we have this in-person community where we can support students, so why start doing things online? It’s a debate or question that’s hanging over higher education,” said Dr. Eisenberg, who is helping to lead a large study to better understand the effectiveness of online treatment.Traumatic incidents have helped other institutions revamp their intake processes. A 2010 shooting at the University of Texas led its counseling center to develop a crisis-response system now used to assess all students seeking mental health treatment. The university’s “brief assessment and referral team,” or B.A.R.T., aims to identify students’ problems quickly and direct them to the right service.U.T. refers many students to one of the 30 to 40 counseling groups it administers each semester. Among other things, the groups have helped survivors of sexual assault and students exploring different identities. The forums show students they are not alone, which can be a powerful message. They also help reduce the load on university counselors.“We would love to provide all the resources to all the students,” said Christopher Brownson, associate vice president for student affairs and director of the university’s counseling and mental health center. “But the answer to all social and emotional problems in the world cannot be to go see your therapist.”Other institutions have found success with modified counseling sessions. Penn State University has set up a half-dozen drop-in clinics at places like residence halls and student unions where students can consult with a licensed therapist without having to make an appointment.“You drop in, get your answer and go on your way,” said Ben Locke, senior director for counseling and psychological services. “It fundamentally changes the interaction.”Dozens of universities have placed therapists around their campuses, making it easier for students to find help in a convenient location. The University of Michigan has 12 “embedded” counselors, including psychologists and social workers, in its schools of engineering, dentistry and pharmacy. Other schools have placed full-time counselors in the athletic department, where they help players recover from head injuries or overcome mental performance blocks.The University of South Florida has gathered data on the students who seek mental health counseling at its main campus, in Tampa. It has found that about a quarter of them don’t need a therapist. They often just need better time-management or anxiety-reducing skills, said Rita DeBate, associate vice president for health and wellness.To help address those issues, the university created “relaxation stations” that include massage chairs, bean bags and nap pods — chairs that cost more than $10,000 each and have quickly become the most sought-after seats on campus.“We’d love it if we had a lazy river,” Dr. DeBate says, referring to the ultimate student amenity. But once students sink into one of those chairs, letting the white noise settle over them, it’s almost as nice, she says.Mr. Biehn, the Ithaca College student, has not found many relaxing moments since applying for his sixth medical leave last fall. The former high school class president, who was on a full academic scholarship at Ithaca, has tried dozens of medicines, but nothing seems to work. He hopes to finish his degree someday, but he has no plans to return to the college.Late last month, after sounding hopeful on a phone call with a reporter, he slipped into a dark place, returning to the psychiatric ward for another week. At his lowest moments, he said, he lies in bed, feeling numb.“I’m basically dead to the world,” he said, “even though there’s just enough breathing going on to call me alive.”AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLOS ANGELES — Pop star Britney Spears said on Wednesday she was taking a little "me time" after a report she checked herself into a mental health facility to help cope with her father's illness.Spears, 37, announced in January that she was pulling out of all her concerts and work commitments to be with her family after her father Jamie came close to death in November after suffering a ruptured colon. On Wednesday, the "Stronger" singer posted a message on her Instagram account saying, "We all need to take time for a little 'me time'." She also posted a quote reading "Fall in love with taking care of yourself, mind, body, spirit.”Celebrity website TMZ said Spears voluntarily checked herself into a residential mental health facility about a week ago.A source close to the singer said Jamie Spears was not doing well after a second surgery three weeks ago, and that Britney was finding his prolonged illness hard to deal with."They are very close. She just wants to take time to focus on herself," the source told Reuters.Jamie Spears is credited with reviving the career of his teen sensation daughter after her life spiraled out of control in 2007-08. He remains the court-approved conservator of her business affairs.Spears became a pop phenomenon in 1999 with her debut single "...Baby One More Time" and subsequent hits like "Oops!...I Did It Again." She made a comeback in late 2008 with the album and world tour "Circus" and has performed in Las Vegas since 2014.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressPINE ISLAND, Minn. — A Minnesota dairy farmer frustrated by the industry's rising financial pressures has taken to social media to voice his concerns in an emotional video that's been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.Mark Berg, 26, told the Star Tribune that he posted the six-minute-long Facebook video Monday after arguing with his family about how to save their 200-cow dairy farm in Pine Island."Literally just got done arguing with my dad. Just arguing, screaming back and forth. And it never used to be that way, you know, it never did," Berg says in the video. "And it's not our fault. It isn't our fault. It isn't fair."Brushing back tears, he talks about his father telling him that he has less than when he started the business 40 years ago.Minnesota saw the median income at a dairy farm drop from about $43,000 last year to less than $15,000. Roughly one out of 10 dairy farms in the state has ceased operations.Berg explains that his family has been taking out loans to pay their bills, and that they need to sell some of their cattle due to depleted feed supplies and years of low milk prices."We're not asking to make a million," he says. "But when you literally work day in day out, all the time, for nothing? We've gained nothing."Talking about the desperation that many in the industry feel, Berg says he knows of farmers who have died by suicide.State data about suicide among farmers isn't readily available, but there are efforts throughout the state to address mental health in the farming industry. The University of Minnesota Extension began organizing a mental health workshop called Farming in Tough Times after a farmer died by suicide in fall 2018. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture has set up a crisis hotline and other stress-coping resources for farmers on the agency's website.Berg's video was posted with a note that read: "To the Dairy Community, I know you are hurting, hang in there if you can."He told the Star he posted the video because he "had to get something off his shoulders.""I didn't know if anybody would listen," Berg said. "I feel like I was at my weakest point."The video has been viewed more than 290,000 times.AdvertisementSupported byBy Palko KaraszLONDON — With even Silicon Valley worrying about the effect of technology exposure on young people, Britain’s top doctors on Thursday issued advice to families about social media and screen use. Their prescriptions: Leave phones outside the bedroom. Screen-free meals are a good idea. When in doubt, don’t upload. And get more exercise.“Technology can be a wonderful thing,” Britain’s chief medical officers, who hold advisory positions similar to that of the surgeon general in America, wrote in a document published on Thursday. “But too much time sitting down or using mobile devices can get in the way of important, healthy activities,” they said.The medical officers declined to set age and time limits, saying that there was not enough evidence to do so. The American Academy of Pediatrics gave more specific guidelines in 2016, urging parents to keep infants under 18 months away from screens and to restrict the time young children spend using media.Reports from Silicon Valley last year suggested that even people at the cutting edge of digital technology worried about their own children’s exposure to screens. Some families there have hired nannies to keep their children offline.There is little consensus on where the balance lies between the benefits and harmful effects of using smartphones and social media. Health experts are increasingly leaning on the side of prevention, but the lack of a substantial body of proof has prompted some authors to wonder whether limiting screen time is the right approach.The British doctors based their advice, in part, on data from the Millennium Cohort Study, which has followed the lives of people born in Britain in 2000 and 2001. Researchers at University College London used data from nearly 11,000 young people who are taking part in the study. They published their findings on social media use and teenagers’ mental health in January.The University College London paper found that lengthy social media use could have a negative effect on sleep patterns, self-esteem and body image, and expose young people to online harassment.“We showed that these were linked to depressive symptoms,” Yvonne Kelly, a professor of epidemiology and public health at University College who is an author of the study, said in a phone interview on Thursday.According to the data in the paper, just under 40 percent of girls and 25 percent of boys were experiencing online bullying, for example.Professor Kelly emphasized that the content and context of social media use mattered more than time spent on it. She noted that the rapid evolution of social media had made it difficult to collect evidence and to make firmer recommendations about its use.In their guidelines, the chief medical officers said that an association had been observed between the use of social media and mental health problems, but that “cause and effect are not yet fully understood.”It may be that children and young people “who already have mental health problems are more likely to spend more time on social media,” the document said.Still, the voices urging action have grown recently. Last year Britain’s health minister, Matt Hancock, issued a warning to parents about evidence on the impact of social media use on children’s mental health, and the Royal College of Pediatrics published its first guidelines on the health impacts of screen time last year.An earlier version of this article misidentified the organization that set guidelines for children’s use of media in the United States in 2016. It is the American Academy of Pediatrics, not the American Association of Pediatrics.Follow Palko Karasz on Twitter: @karaszpalko.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressLONDON — British police say a man suspected of purposefully driving into parked cars in front of the Ukrainian Embassy in London has been hospitalized for mental health treatment.London's Metropolitan Police force said officers fired at the 40-year-old driver's vehicle and took him into custody Saturday after he allegedly rammed the Ukrainian ambassador's car and several others outside the embassy.London police say he also drove his car toward officers.No one was injured.

They are rich in vitamin B12, he said, which studies suggest may help to reduce brain shrinkage. They are also well stocked with long chain omega-3 fatty acids, deficiencies of which have been linked to higher risk for suicide and depression. But shellfish are not the only food he is enthusiastic about. Dr. Ramsey is a pioneer in the field of nutritional psychiatry, which attempts to apply what science is learning about the impact of nutrition on the brain and mental health.Dr. Ramsey argues that a poor diet is a major factor contributing to the epidemic of depression, which is the top driver of disability for Americans aged 15 to 44, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Together with Samantha Elkrief, a chef and food coach who sits in on many of his patient sessions, he often counsels patients on how better eating may lead to better mental health.The irony, he says, is that most Americans are overfed in calories yet starved of the vital array of micronutrients that our brains need, many of which are found in common plant foods. A survey published in 2017 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that only one in 10 adults meets the minimal daily federal recommendations for fruit and vegetables — at least one-and-a-half to two cups per day of fruit and two to three cups per day of vegetables. Nutritional psychiatrists like Dr. Ramsey prescribe antidepressants and other medications, where appropriate, and engage in talk therapy and other traditional forms of counseling. But they argue that fresh and nutritious food can be a potent addition to the mix of available therapies.Americans routinely change what they eat in order to lose weight, control their blood sugar levels and lower artery-clogging cholesterol. But Dr. Ramsey says that it is still rare for people to pay attention to the food needs of the most complex and energy-consuming organ in the body, the human brain.The patient Dr. Ramsey was seeing that day credits the nutritional guidance, including cutting down on many of the processed and fried foods and fatty meats that used to be part of his diet, with improving his mood and helping him overcome a long-term addiction to alcohol.“It’s one part of the whole package that helps alleviate my depression and helps me to feel better,” he said.Research on the impact of diet on mental functioning is relatively new, and food studies can be difficult to perform and hard to interpret, since so many factors go into what we eat and our general well-being. But a study of more than 12,000 Australians published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2016 found that individuals who increased the number of servings of fruits and vegetables that they ate reported that they were happier and more satisfied with their life than those whose diets remained the same. Another study of 422 young adults from New Zealand and the United States showed higher levels of mental health and well-being for those who ate more fresh fruits and vegetables. Interestingly, the same benefits did not accrue to those who ate canned fruits and vegetables. “We think this is due to the higher nutrient content of raw fruits and vegetables, particularly B vitamins and vitamin C, which are vulnerable to heat degradation,” said Tamlin Conner, a study author and senior lecturer at the University of Otago.One of the first randomized controlled trials to test whether dietary change may be effective in helping to treat depression was published in 2017. In the study, led by Felice Jacka, a psychiatric epidemiologist in Australia, participants who were coached to follow a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks reported improvements in mood and lower anxiety levels. Those who received general coaching showed no such benefits. A Mediterranean diet, rich in whole grains, legumes and seafood as well as nutrient-dense leafy vegetables that are high in the fiber, promotes a diverse population of helpful bacteria in the gut. Research suggests that a healthy gut microbiome may be important in the processing of neurotransmitters like serotonin that regulate mood. “Our imaging studies show that the brains of people who follow a Mediterranean-style diet typically look younger, have larger volumes and are more metabolically active than people who eat a more typical Western diet,” said Dr. Lisa Mosconi, the director of the Women’s Brain Initiative at the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. Such brain benefits may be protective against the onset of dementia, she said.Dr. Mosconi noted that “there is no one diet that fits all” but advises patients to cut out processed foods, minimize meat and dairy and eat more whole foods like fatty fish, vegetables and whole grains and legumes to cut the risk of developing degenerative brain diseases associated with aging.She and Dr. Ramsey both recommend “eating the rainbow,” that is, consuming a wide array of colorful fruits and vegetables like peppers, blueberries, sweet potatoes, kale and tomatoes. Such foods are high in phytonutrients that may help to reduce harmful inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, and promote the growth of new brain cells throughout our adult years, they say.Dr. Emily Deans, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, cautions that a plant-only diet may carry some risks. Some large observational studies suggest, for example, that strict vegetarians and vegans may have somewhat higher rates of depression and eating disorders than those who eat a more varied diet. Those on a meat-free diet may also need to take supplements to provide missing nutrients. “Some of the key nutrients for the brain, like long chain omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, are simply not found in vegetable only diets,” says Dr. Deans.

Though he is technically free, he is still confined to a cell because of a Kafkaesque bureaucratic dilemma: The state requires people like him to be released to a supportive housing facility, but there is not one available.Lawyers for C.J. and five other mentally ill men filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan on Wednesday seeking to force Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to address a shortage of housing for people with serious mental illnesses who need help adjusting to life outside prison walls.The men are no longer being held in prison because they committed offenses, their lawyers argue, but because the state has determined they are likely to become homeless once released — a practice they contend amounts to discrimination under federal civil rights laws.Four of the men, including C.J., have finished their maximum prison sentences and maintain their confinement also violates their constitutional rights to due process and protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiffs have asked the court to allow them to proceed anonymously because their lawsuit discusses sensitive personal information and they fear retaliation from prison guards.Corrections records indicate the men are in “residential treatment facilities” — housing where residents are able to move about freely to seek jobs, visit family and pursue educational opportunities.But the lawsuit says that label, as the state has applied it to 13 prisons, is a fraud, because the men are being held and treated as other prisoners are. They are locked in cells that have room for a bed and a few possessions. They are required to wear inmate uniforms. They cannot receive packages.“Though labeled ‘releasees,’ they remain prisoners in every respect,” the complaint said.The state continues to hold the men “because they are unable to secure a community-based mental health housing placement that does not exist due to lack of available beds,” the complaint said. In effect, the state has lengthened their incarceration, “undermining the most basic principle undergirding the criminal justice system: that a criminal sentence, once imposed by a judge, means what it says,” the lawsuit saidThe lawsuit, which names the state corrections department and mental health office as defendants, was filed by the Legal Aid Society and Disability Rights New York, who are seeking class-action status on behalf of all inmates held in state prisons beyond their release dates solely because they are waiting to be placed in supportive housing.It remained unclear on Wednesday how many mentally ill people were being held in prison past their release dates.Jessica Riley, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Mental Health, declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit, but said the state has “one of the most robust supportive housing networks in the nation for individuals with mental illness,” with about 44,000 units.C.J. has been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and antisocial personality disorder, court papers said. As his release date approached, he was enrolled in a re-entry program that was preparing him to be set free in Orange County, where he was looking forward to seeing his daughter for the first time since he went to prison. He had obtained a G.E.D. and a vocational certificate in prison and hoped to get a job.But the day before he was scheduled to be released, C.J. was transferred to another prison, and later, to the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville. His mental condition has worsened since his release date passed, and he has been repeatedly placed on suicide watch, according to the lawsuit.“Every day is hard, very hard,” C.J. said in written responses to questions from The New York Times. “I wake up and I look around and I don’t understand why I am here.”The lawsuit does not seek an order requiring the six men to be freed. Rather, it asks that the state remove “the only barrier to their release” by creating more supportive housing for mentally ill people being released from prison.The complaint cites a 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., which held that public institutions must provide community-based services to people with mental illnesses who need and desire them.For decades since the civil rights movement, public pressure had built on states to take mentally ill people out of psychiatric hospitals and place them in settings where they could participate in society, an effort called “deinstitutionalization.”But over the years, as psychiatric hospitals closed and lawmakers toughened crime and sentencing policies, more people with mental illnesses wound up incarcerated. Though prisons and jails developed treatment programs, few of them were effective, advocates for the mentally ill said.About 4,000 people receiving mental health treatment in New York State prisons are released each year, and more than half of them have serious disorders like schizophrenia that severely limit their ability to function independently, according to the state Office of Mental Health.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has committed the state to building 20,000 new supportive housing units, and state lawmakers so far have allocated $2.6 billion to create the first 6,000 units by 2021.But the lawsuit asserts that, under Governor Cuomo, the Office of Mental Health has neglected requests from counties across the state to build additional housing for former prisoners with mental disorders.Such housing programs, where residents receive psychiatric care and learn skills like cooking and using mass transit, offer opportunities to participate in public life that prisons do not, mental health advocates say.But waiting lists have grown longer as the state has eliminated beds from its psychiatric hospitals. The roughly 44,000 spaces available for the mentally ill are about half of what is needed, said Antonia Lasicki, the executive director of the Association for Community Living, which represents supportive-housing operators.AdvertisementSupported byThough the wealthy tend to be healthier and fill fewer prescriptions over all, they’re likelier to purchase medications for some serious diseases. By Kevin Quealy and Margot Sanger-KatzThere are many, many things that rich people buy in larger quantities. It turns out medications for certain serious diseases may be one of them.A new analysis has found that, for some types of medications, income is a pretty strong predictor of how often someone is picking up a drug to treat an ailment.The analysis, by GoodRx, a company that tracks prescription drug prices, looked at how often residents of different neighborhoods filled prescriptions for different categories of drugs.Patients in wealthier neighborhoods were much more likely to pick up prescriptions for lifestyle problems: erectile dysfunction, baldness, anti-wrinkle Botox injections and an eye medicine that thickens eyelashes. This may be unsurprising. But the analysis also showed that richer patients were more likely to buy drugs for certain serious conditions, including mental health disorders. This was the case even though the analysis showed that income doesn’t track with overall prescription use. These prescriptions for serious conditions were filled disproportionately in rich neighborhoods despite evidence that the rich tend to be in overall better health. In fact, people in rich neighborhoods filled fewer prescriptions than people in middle-class neighborhoods. The blend of data suggests that, while prescriptions and income don’t track well over all, there are points where they do.The relationship between income and prescription drug purchasing is more complicated than whether someone has money to spend at the pharmacy. Depending on income and life circumstances, Americans may have different odds of developing certain illnesses and of seeking treatment — even before the direct cost of medicines becomes an issue.“There are definitely a bunch of financial barriers before you even get to the point of getting to fill a drug,” said Stacie B. Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. She said social and cultural factors could matter, too: Evidence has shown that doctors are less likely to prescribe pain medicines to black patients than white ones, for example. Niteesh Choudhry, a professor of medicine and public health at Harvard, said that his research hadn’t shown a clear relationship between income and prescription drug use. Instead, he said, cultural and racial factors — and the details of insurance coverage — were better predictors. When it comes to treatments for very common conditions, “the income relationships are probably not linear,” he said.Several experts in the demographics of drug use said all those factors might explain the higher usage of medications for mental health problems among wealthier people. Some mental health problems are more prevalent among Americans with lower incomes, evidence shows. But longtime holes in the health care system mean that richer patients are more likely to have private insurance or extra money to pay for psychiatric care that is not covered by insurance. And some people in lower-income communities may feel more stigma around mental health diagnoses. A similar dynamic could explain lower prescription rates for birth control among lower-income women. Under Obamacare, all women with health insurance should be able to get contraception with no co-payment. So cost at the pharmacy counter can’t alone explain the differences. But higher-income women may be more likely to have a regular doctor to prescribe pills. (The data shows that emergency contraceptive purchases, also available without co-payment, were more common in lower-income neighborhoods.) The high cost of EpiPens alone may explain some of the differences in usage. Current guidance is for patients to stock several of the devices, used to treat life-threatening allergic reactions, and replace them often. But their high cost may lead some poorer patients to make do with fewer or older ones, while those with more disposable income might stock extras.Some drugs seem to be taken about equally regardless of income. The use of antibiotics appears to be roughly the same for middle-class and rich Americans. These drugs are used for some serious diseases, have few over-the-counter substitutes, and tend to be inexpensive.Some drugs are much more commonly used at the low end of the income scale. Consider treatments for hepatitis C and H.I.V. These are diseases that disproportionately affect low-income Americans, and that pattern is reflected in the prescription purchasing patterns.The GoodRx data looked at a sample of 53 million retail pharmacy purchases in 39 large metropolitan areas over a year ending in October 2018, then divided them according to the income characteristics of the people who lived in the census tract where the pharmacy was located.This is not exactly the same as tracking individual customers by income, but most people buy drugs at pharmacies near their homes. The data includes drug purchases by people with both public and private health insurance, and by some customers who buy their medications using cash. Analysts at GoodRx then grouped drugs prescribed for various diagnoses to build categories. They also made some adjustments to the data in cases where the sample overrepresented one kind of insurance.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCLINTON, S.C. — The Latest on two shootings in two days in South Carolina hospitals (all times local):9:15 p.m.Authorities have charged a 27-year-old man with attempted murder and kidnapping in a shooting that wounded a police officer in a South Carolina emergency room.An arrest warrant says Kevin Boyce Patterson dragged his father at gunpoint across the waiting room at Laurens County Hospital around 2 a.m. Thursday.Authorities say a Greenville Health Authority Police Department officer confronted and was shot by Patterson.Investigators say the officer fired back, hitting Patterson in the arm.The hospital said in a statement the officer was treated and released.

They identified 351 variations that may be connected to when people go to bed. While these variants are just the beginning of exploring the differences in chronotypes, the study goes on to suggest tantalizing links between chronotype and mental health.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The researchers drew on data from 23andMe, the genetic testing company, and the UK Biobank, which tracks hundreds of thousands of volunteer subjects in Britain, about 85,000 of whom wear activity monitors that record their movements.Those data were key, said Michael Weedon, a bioinformaticist at University of Exeter in England and an author of the new paper; earlier studies had relied only on people’s subjective opinions of whether they were morning people. Using the activity monitors, however, the team was able to confirm that self-reported morning people did go to sleep earlier — and people with the most morning-linked gene variants went to bed 25 minutes earlier than people with the fewest. Morning people did not sleep longer or better than night people; all that differed was the time that they went to sleep.The genes flagged in the study play a wide variety of roles in the body.Many seem to play a role in brain tissues, and others are already known to be central to the body’s circadian rhythm. A few were active mainly in the retina, and the people who possessed an uncommon version of one of these genes had an increased chance of being night owls, said Samuel Jones, a researcher at the University of Exeter and the study’s lead author. That could imply a potential a connection between how the eye responds to sunlight and when a person sleeps.Another gene was involved in the body’s processing of caffeine and nicotine, two of our species’ favorite stimulants. Continued study of these and the other genes could provide leads for future work on the biology of sleep timing.“The most interesting ones are the ones where we don’t know what it is,” said Dr. Weedon.When the researchers crunched the numbers on chronotype’s connection to mental health, they also found that self-identified morning people reported a higher level of general well-being. People in this group also were less likely to report having depression or schizophrenia, in line with epidemiological studies suggesting that evening people struggle with mental health.AdvertisementSupported byA “formulation” gathers the biological, psychological and social factors that lead to a mental illness — and offers clues to the way out of suffering.By Lisa PryorContributing Opinion WriterWhen psychiatry is in the news, so often it is for a controversy over diagnosis. Do psychiatrists mislabel grief as depression? Should internet addiction be considered a mental health disorder? Are children with behavioral difficulties too often tagged as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?With such a focus on diagnosis and classification, you would be forgiven for thinking that psychiatry is a profession devoted merely to sorting and labeling humans. This is highlighted by the common description of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — the thick volume published by the American Psychiatric Association listing the various diseases of the mind — as the “bible” of psychiatry.In reality, the D.S.M., the abbreviation by which it is commonly known, is more like a dictionary than a bible. It is an explanation of the human mind no more than a dictionary is an explanation of literature.There is another psychiatry concept that gets less of an airing in public but that could be more helpful for understanding how many psychiatrists think about the mind — and how any of us can think about mental suffering. This concept is the psychiatric formulation.If a diagnosis is a label, a formulation is more like a story. In a few sentences, a formulation gathers up all the biological, psychological and social factors that have led to a person becoming unwell and considers how these factors interconnect. In doing so, it provides clues to the pathway out of suffering.This story might take into account the individual’s genetic predisposition for mental illness, attachment to a primary caregiver as a child, developmental trauma, intellectual functioning, economic circumstances, illicit drug use or complications created by physical illness, such as thyroid disease or chronic pain.As you may have noticed, these factors are not located solely within the brain, nor are they solely located within the individual.For me, a medical doctor training to be a psychiatrist, the formulation is a reminder that however far our understanding of the brain advances, in terms of its myriad receptors and neurotransmitters, this organ never exists in a vacuum.The brain exists within a human body, which in turn exists within a family, a culture, a society, an economy. When factors outside the brain contribute to mental illness, then the solutions to those problems may also exist outside the brain. Indeed, some of the most valuable mental health interventions we have might be preventive. I am thinking here of measures to reduce poverty and child abuse, for example.Let’s consider an example of a formulation. The diagnosis “major depressive disorder” may not tell you much about a person, but consider a formulation for an individual, which might go something like this: “Forty-six-year-old single mother of two presents with a three-month history of depressive symptoms including low mood, insomnia and poor appetite (with weight loss). Her condition was precipitated by psychosocial stressors, including unstable housing and credit-card debt since the breakdown of her marriage eight months ago. This is on a background of an introverted and passive temperament and a childhood in which her parents encouraged dependency, and this was followed by a marriage in which her husband had complete control of finances. There is a strong family history of depression; her mother and maternal grandfather were hospitalized for this condition. Protective factors include a strong network of friends and a willingness to engage with therapy.”Obviously people who all have the same diagnosis of “major depressive disorder” can have different formulations. The combination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating and protective factors will be different for everyone. If a diagnosis is a stamp, a formulation is more like a fingerprint, unique to each individual.In the hypothetical example above, treatment may not be limited to medication; it might include a suite of other interventions. Long-term psychotherapy to help build confidence and a sense of self-efficacy might be one element, as would other measures that on the face of it might not seem to be within the realm of psychiatric treatment. For example, it would make sense to provide assistance for obtaining safe and affordable housing if unstable living arrangements helped cause spiraling feelings of hopelessness. Similarly, helping the person find a course to learn budgeting skills or get a job might be beneficial.If you have come to believe from what you have read that psychiatry is the study of the isolated and disembodied brain, you might be surprised to learn how important this component of the psychiatric process is and how long it has been around.One of the early key proponents of this biopsychosocial model of mental illness was George L. Engel, an internist and psychiatrist who practiced in Rochester, N.Y., for most of his career, starting in the 1940s. Working with both physical and psychiatric illness, he was well placed to consider the relationship between the mind and the body, between emotions and disease.He set out his ideas succinctly in 1977 in a landmark article in the journal Science. In this essay, Engel articulated why psychiatry should not be drawn too far into the medical model of disease, and why, in fact, medicine itself would do well to look beyond this model, which he suggested did not fully account for mental illness or physical illness, for schizophrenia or even diabetes.The biopsychosocial formulation dovetails nicely with more recent developments in mental health, such as trauma-informed care, a model developed for patients who have suffered traumatic experiences such as abuse and assault. The goal is to avoid traumatizing them again in offering the very services meant to help them. Often this approach is summarized as moving from thinking, “What is wrong with you?” to considering, “What happened to you?” Like the formulation, a label is reframed as a story.The biopsychosocial formulation also offers much to all of us, when we think about our own well-being and mental health, the factors leading to our own flourishing, or its opposite.None of us are static objects, we have histories and stories, we change over time. Who we are today is influenced by the sum of the things that have happened to us along the way, but how things are today is not how they are always destined to be.So when something is wrong we would do well to ask not just, “What is my diagnosis?” but instead, “What is my formulation?”Lisa Pryor, a medical doctor, is the author, most recently, of “A Small Book About Drugs” and a contributing opinion writer.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

HollowWhen Ronald Braunstein conducts an orchestra, there’s no sign of his bipolar disorder. He’s confident and happy.Music isn’t his only medicine, but its healing power is potent. Scientific research has shown that music helps fight depression, lower blood pressure and reduce pain.The National Institutes of Health has a partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts called Sound Health: Music and the Mind, to expand on the links between music and mental health. It explores how listening to, performing or creating music involves brain circuitry that can be harnessed to improve health and well-being.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: “We’re bringing neuroscientists together with musicians to speak each other’s language. Mental health conditions are among those areas we’d like to see studied.”Mr. Braunstein, 63, has experienced the benefits of music for his own mental health and set out to bring them to others by founding orchestras in which the performers are all people affected by mental illness.Upon graduating from the Juilliard School in his early 20s, he entered a summer program at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria, and in 1979 became the first American to win the prestigious Karajan International Conducting Competition in Berlin. His career took off. He worked with orchestras in Europe, Israel, Australia and Tokyo. At the time, he didn’t have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.But looking back, he can see that his disorder contributed to his success, and his talent masked the condition.“The unbelievable mania I experienced helped me win the Karajan,” he said. “I learned repertoire fast. I studied through the night and wouldn’t sleep. I didn’t eat because if I did, it would take away my edge.”“My bipolar disorder was just under the line of being under control,” he said. “It wasn’t easily detected. Most people thought I was weird.”He always sensed something was askew. When he was 15, his father took him to a doctor who diagnosed “bad nerves” and prescribed Valium.As his career progressed, things started to unravel, and his behavior grew increasingly erratic. He was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 35. His manager dropped him as a client, and he was fired from a conducting job in Vermont.It was there he met Caroline Whiddon, who had been the chairwoman of the Youth Orchestra Division of the League of American Orchestras. She had been given a diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorder more than 20 years earlier, and had played French horn professionally, which she described as “a notorious instrument that’s known for breaking people.” Mr. Braunstein reached out to her about creating an orchestra that welcomed musicians with mental illnesses and family members and friends who support them. “I never thought I’d go back to playing French horn again,” she said. “Ronald gave me back the gift of music.”Mr. Braunstein called his new venture the Me2/Orchestra, because when he told other musicians about his mental health diagnosis, they’d often respond, “Me too.”Since the term #MeToo is now associated with sexual assault cases, people sometimes ask if the orchestra is connected to that cause. “It gives us an opportunity to explain that we were founded in 2011,” in Burlington, Vt., “before the Me Too movement began,” Ms. Whiddon said.In 2014, a second orchestra, Me2/Boston, was created. In between, in 2013, Mr. Braunstein and Ms. Whiddon got married.Each orchestra performs between six and eight times a year. Each has about 50 musicians, both amateur and professional, ranging in age from 13 to over 80, and they rehearse once a week. New affiliate ensembles in Portland, Ore., and Atlanta follow similar schedules.Mr. Braunstein gives free private lessons to those who want to polish their skills.Me2/Orchestra is a nonprofit, and the musicians are all volunteers. Ms. Whiddon raises money through an annual letter-writing campaign to cover expenses, with support from more than 100 donors.“When we perform at a hospital, center for the homeless or correctional facility,” Ms. Whiddon said, “the cost of that performance is covered by corporate sponsorships, grants or donations from individuals, so the performance is free to those who attend.”Participating in Me2/Boston allowed Nancy-Lee Mauger, age 55, to pick up the French horn again. The note on the rehearsal door — “This is a stigma-free zone” — made her feel welcome.Ms. Mauger had played French horn until her mental illness made it impossible to perform. She has diagnoses of dissociative identity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.“In 2009, I was playing a Christmas Eve gig,” she said. “It was at the same church, with the same quintet, choir and music that I had played every Christmas Eve for 15 years. This particular night felt different. I had trouble focusing my eyes. At one point, I could not read music or play my horn.”It lasted about two minutes, and she thought she was having a stroke. In fact, it was her mental illness.“I learned that little parts of me would come out and try to play my horn during gigs,” she said. “The problem was that they didn’t know how to play. This became such an obvious problem that I quit.”Now, after four years of intensive therapy, she is able to play again.At each performance, a few musicians briefly talk about their mental illnesses and take questions from the audience. “Instead of thinking people with mental illnesses are lazy or dangerous, they see what we’re capable of,” Mr. Braunstein said. “It has a positive effect on all of us.”Jessica Stuart, now 34, stopped playing violin in her mid-20s when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “Joining the Me2/Orchestra in Boston in 2014 was the first time I had played in years,” she said. “I cannot count the ways the orchestra helps me. It has allowed me to overcome the shame I felt about living with mental illness. I no longer feel I have to hide an important part of my life from the rest of the world.”Jessie Bodell, a 26-year-old flute player who has borderline personality disorder, said he finds rehearsals fun, relaxed and democratic.He noted that unlike most orchestras, Me2 doesn’t have first, second or third positions. “There isn’t an underlying, tense, competitive feeling here,” he said.“We’ve seen when you sing or play an instrument, it doesn’t just activate one part of your brain,” said Dr. Collins of the National Institutes of Health. “A whole constellation of brain areas becomes active. Our response to music is separate from other interventions such as asking people to recall memories or listen to another language.”Partnering with Dr. Collins on Sound Health is Renée Fleming, the renowned soprano and artistic adviser to the Kennedy Center. “The first goal is to move music therapy forward as a discipline,” she said. “The second is to educate the public and enlighten people about the power of music to heal.”FootnotesThe rapper, whose real name is Bobby Hall, has branched out with a debut novel, “Supermarket.”CreditCreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesSupported byBy Lovia GyarkyeBobby Hall, better known as the Grammy-nominated rapper Logic, started writing his debut novel, “Supermarket,” four years ago.   He had released “The Incredible True Story,” a dystopian concept album in which two men search for a planet named Paradise in the wake of Earth’s destruction, and finished the script for a film, “Everything Must Go,” now in development with J.J. Abrams’s production company, Bad Robot. He was looking for a new project. “I didn’t want to necessarily just be stuck in music,” he said. “Supermarket,” just published by Simon & Schuster, is a psychological thriller that centers on Flynn, an aspiring writer who has been dumped by his girlfriend. Depressed and desperate for change, he takes a job at a supermarket, hoping to find inspiration through daily minutiae. But nothing is what it seems, and the novel quickly takes twists and turns while tackling issues including depression and anxiety.It’s not the first time he has addressed mental health in his work: His song “1-800-273-8255,” titled after the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, has gone platinum five times.Hall, 29, recorded an accompanying soundtrack timed to the novel’s release this week. He does not consider himself a big reader, he said, but credits Indiana Jones novels and H.G. Wells’s “The Time Machine” as inspirations for the kind of story he wanted to tell. “Bobby is the quintessential multi-hyphenate. He’s a natural storyteller,” Stuart Roberts, Hall’s editor at Simon & Schuster, wrote in an email. “I was instantly taken by the book’s voice and inventiveness.” I talked to Hall about his debut as a writer, mental health, the importance of music to him and what he hopes his fans will take away from this project.“Supermarket” deals with a number of mental health issues — from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. What research did you do before writing the book? The research I did was all personal. I had an anxiety attack and almost passed out when I was in line to see “Star Wars” in December 2015. I was in the most depressed, anxiety ridden place of my life. My mother was bipolar. She took heavy medication to deal with it, and I grew up with friends who were schizophrenic, so I experienced that firsthand. Did you face any challenges while writing the book? How did the process differ, if at all, from writing music? One of the biggest challenges was writing something that stemmed from real life. Nobody wants to talk about anxiety and depression and being scared and feeling crippled at times. It’s not a fun thing to discuss. I have written scripts for my albums before, I have done concept albums, so I guess it is something that has been building up.What do you hope readers to take away from it?I guess the biggest thing is as long as you deal with your problems head-on and face your demons, whatever they may be — mental, physical, emotional — if you truly deal with it, it gets better. And that you can do anything you want. I am a dude with no formal education. I didn’t even graduate from high school. But you can’t let that tear you down.Your characters listen to a lot of contemporary music and artists, like Toro y Moi and Rex Orange County. Can you talk about the relationship between music and the novel?I thought it would be really cool if when readers see that artist’s name and the song on that page, maybe they will play that song while they read. We tend to associate our emotions and experiences with what we are listening to or watching. I just thought it would be cool to add these artists who have given me great memories and pass that on to readers.Are there any other songs or albums or artists you were listening to while writing the book?Oh, definitely — I actually created a playlist on Spotify. Did you always know that you were going to record the soundtrack?It definitely came from writing the book. I was at my old house and making these songs about love. I was feeling kind of lonely, and I realized that is also how Flynn felt. When I was writing these songs for a woman that didn’t even exist at the time, it kind of hit me like, I want to do more than just rap. I love hip-hop, I love rap, it’s in my blood. And it is scary as a musician to have a world of people who know who you are, and that when you do something different, different is not good. Nobody likes different. These were songs that almost would have never come out because I would have been too scared. But I think that fear is a good thing. Let’s talk about the album. How does it relate to the book?AdvertisementSupported byBritain’s Big SqueezeBy Benjamin MuellerBIRMINGHAM, England — On a foggy afternoon last fall, a suicidal patient walked out of Solihull Hospital and disappeared. Alerted by hospital staff, police officers discovered her on a Birmingham street, having downed a bottle of vodka.They took her to their station house, waited for her to sober up and called social service agencies and charities for help. Their calls were rebuffed or never answered.At midnight, Constable Richard Chant finally persuaded the woman to go to a different hospital, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. In the eight hours that officers worked on her case, the West Midlands Police Department received 1,452 other emergency calls, and in many of those cases, hours or days went by before an officer responded.“It was a bit of checkmate,” Constable Chant said. “We need to support these people in crisis, but the police are not the right ones to be dealing with them.”Constable Chant’s burden reflects the strained state of policing in Britain’s era of economic austerity: The number and range of emergency calls has risen sharply in Birmingham and in many other cities, but there are now far fewer officers to respond. The economic uncertainties around Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union mean that budget pressures could be far from over.The West Midlands Police has seen $220 million in budget cuts since the Conservative-led government’s austerity program began in 2010. The department has slashed a quarter of its officers, leaving numbers nearly as low as when the force was formed in 1974. Across England and Wales, police staffing has fallen by about 20,000 officers.The problem is compounded by parallel cuts to social services. Addiction services, housing benefits, gang mediation programs and social services for both adults and children have all been pared back, creating metastasizing problems that often fall to the police.There are also questions about whether the cuts are contributing to a spike in violent crime. Murders and robberies, while not near American crime rates, have surged to their highest levels in a decade in England and Wales. Knife offenses rose in 2018 for the fourth straight year, and crimes involving firearms dipped after rising for several years.Since the mid-1990s, Britain has registered a marked decline in violent crime, national crime surveys show, and it is too soon to know if the recent uptick is an anomaly or a trend. But much of the recent debate has focused nonetheless on the impact of austerity — particularly on how crime calls are going unanswered as officers work to plug holes in the country’s safety net.“If you’re putting your faith in the police to sort out these problems, you’re really firing a sort of pea shooter at something that’s a cannon-sized problem,” said Richard Garside, the director of the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London.Hours devoted to health and welfare calls leave less time to collect evidence and solve crimes. As a result, victims who are not in immediate danger routinely wait days for a police interview. Officers say they have essentially given up investigating property crimes, dropping burglary complaints unless the homeowners can find a fingerprint or provide surveillance video.Police spending ballooned in the early 2000s under a Labour government, which gave officers a broad charge to clamp down on small-scale misbehavior and impose order in accordance with the “broken windows” theory of policing that was then much in vogue. No longer.“It was all right, the police being the jack-of-all-trades, when there was a necessary amount of funding for the police,” Constable Chant said. “But if you’ve got 20,000 less police officers, less funding, then somebody needs to make the decision about what they want us to do.”Two hours north of London by train, the West Midlands contains former factory towns and cities that were once the industrial heart of England. It is now among the poorest regions in Britain.Last summer, as the West Midlands Police confronted a backlog of more than 2,000 unanswered complaints, the department’s leader, Chief Constable Dave Thompson, went on patrol. One woman had filed a complaint about her brother slashing her tires but was more worried about his mental health than the vandalism.“They’d tried the doctor and got nothing; they’d tried a community mental health team and they got nothing,” Chief Constable Thompson said. “I can’t solve this for them, but increasingly, we see calls coming through to the police like that because we’re here 24 hours a day.”On a different afternoon, Inspector Lucy Bird fielded emergency calls in the West Midlands Police dispatch room, her radio crackling with what she called “mispers,” police slang for reports of missing people, many of them mentally ill.One call involved a mentally ill woman who had stolen lighter fluid and was threatening to burn down a grocery store and set herself on fire. Another call about a man who had gone missing before getting his psychiatric medication set off an intense police search.“A good proportion of our jobs on a daily basis are mental health,” Inspector Bird said.In recent decades, the rate of diagnoses of severe mental illness has climbed in England while services have been reduced. In turn, officers in England and Wales detained 60 percent more people for psychiatric reasons in 2015-16 than they did a decade earlier. The police in London now receive a call related to mental illness about once every four minutes.Prime Minister Theresa May has said that health care has been protected from austerity cuts. But mental health trusts were given $134 million less to spend on patient care in 2017, accounting for inflation, compared with five years earlier, the Royal College of Psychiatrists reported. And last year, the Care Quality Commission, a health care regulator, concluded that more than a third of mental health trusts in England were rated as needing to improve patient safety.Since the 1980s, tens of thousands of psychiatric beds have been cut, initially as part of a policy shift to caring for the mentally ill in the community rather than in hospitals. Under austerity, those reductions have continued.In November, a government inspector found that “other organizations rely on the police to effectively ‘pick up the pieces’ after they have gone off duty.” Even small cuts in social services can mean heavier workloads for police officers.Michael Brown, an inspector in the West Midlands force, is now assigned to study mental health for the national College of Policing. The mental health crisis team in his old patrol area once had two nurses who responded to calls from people who said they were unwell.By 2014, Inspector Brown said, the team had been halved, and government policy prohibited the nurse who remained from making calls alone for safety reasons.Many of those calls were rerouted to the police.Inside a police station that closed to the public three years ago, Inspector Warren Hines, a homicide detective, was confronted with a resource crisis. There were more than 50 homicides last year in the West Midlands, roughly twice as many as in 2014, yet he has fewer investigators than ever. Robberies or assaults are supposed to get attention within an hour if the offender has left, yet they can go unanswered for days.On the streets, officers are racing between emergency calls and have less time to patrol a beat. Regular patrols may do little to deter crime, but Inspector Hines said they often provided intelligence essential to his investigations. Officers who used to wait in hot spots for drug dealing or violence now spend more time answering calls.“There was a time when we’d have a pretty good idea of who would be dealing drugs, we’d have a pretty good idea where a lot of the stolen property was being disposed of,” said Inspector Hines, who is also a representative of West Midlands Police Federation, which advocates for officers. “And now we just don’t know.”At the end of May, Inspector Hines was canvassing for witnesses to the killing of a 15-year-old boy. He came upon a taxi driver who, if not likely to be a crucial witness, still could have helped describe the scene. But the man declined to help, saying the police had failed to help him after he reported three robberies.“He said, ‘I don’t really see it’s my job to help you,’” Inspector Hines said.Part of what has slowed response times has been the closing of local police stations and the consolidation of response teams that began in the early years of austerity. Only 10 stations in the West Midlands now have a public counter, down from 48 in 2010, and 14 local stations have been shut completely.Sgt. Richard Cooke, the chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, remembered an assault case in Walsall, an industrial town northwest of Birmingham. A woman called the emergency number to say that her son, who had a history of drug abuse, was trying to kick in her door.The nearest officers were in Wolverhampton, about 10 miles away. By the time they arrived, the woman had been attacked and her son had fled.“That’s happening on a regular basis,” Sergeant Cooke said.For many police departments, as well as for Britain’s still influential tabloids, the answer to the deteriorating service seems simple: more officers. Patterns of taxi robberies and home break-ins are being missed because so many cases are shelved without so much as a cursory investigation, they say. Victims stop calling the police. Criminals are emboldened.“When the criminals realize that their gang is bigger than our gang,” Constable Chant said, “they start exploiting that.”Much of the blame has fallen on Mrs. May, the architect of the cuts as home secretary from 2010 to 2016. Even as she negotiates Britain’s tortured withdrawal from the European Union, she faces the daily ire of officers who have not forgiven her for past crackdowns on corruption in officer associations and on stop-and-frisk tactics, or for the personnel cutbacks.“We think she’s got it in for us,” Sergeant Cooke said.But others say Britain should restore funding for social services rather than expand police forces that are poorly equipped to address a mental health crisis.In mid-December, Mrs. May’s government announced an additional $1.2 billion for the police. Police leaders were quick to lament that much of it would be absorbed by the forces’ growing pension obligations, rather than adding more officers.Kirk Dawes, a former West Midlands police officer, retired from the force and started a mediation program for Birmingham, the site of vicious feuds between gangs like the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.Having studied gang mediation tactics in New Jersey and in Northern Ireland, he took referrals from the police when someone was attacked or when investigators caught wind of a threat to someone’s life.With roughly 100 cases a year in the early 2000s, the mediation team had only one person killed on its watch. The team had an annual budget of roughly $440,000, and Mr. Dawes figures it saved the government millions of dollars in costly homicide investigations. But under austerity, the program’s budget was sharply reduced, until it folded in 2012.By last fall, more than a third of the homicides being investigated by West Midlands detectives were the sort of killings that Mr. Dawes’s team might once have worked to prevent.“All of that was lost,” he said.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressATLANTA — Prolonged solitary confinement and harrowing conditions at a Georgia jail result in a substantial risk of serious psychological harm for mentally ill women held there, a federal lawsuit says.Urine and toilet water pool on the floor of cells and meals of moldy sandwich meat are not uncommon at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail in Union City, the lawsuit filed Wednesday says. Lawyers have observed women in psychological distress lying on the floor, their bodies and the walls of their cells smeared with feces or food.The women are subjected to harmful long-term isolation and those deemed incompetent to stand trial are denied mental health treatment provided to jailed men with similar mental health problems, the lawsuit filed against Fulton County Sheriff Theodore Jackson and four jail officials says.Sheriff's office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.Because of the policies and practices in place at the jail and the unsanitary conditions, mentally ill women held there "continue to face a substantial risk of serious psychological harm and indeed to suffer such harm on a regular basis," the lawsuit says."That harm can result in dramatic worsening of symptoms, decompensation, psychosis, self-injury, and suicide," the lawsuit says.It was filed on behalf of two homeless women diagnosed with serious mental illness who are being held in isolation at the jail and the Georgia Advocacy Office, a private nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights of people with disabilities. It seeks class-action status.Because of their mental illness and psychological deterioration caused by the terrible conditions, some women lose the will or ability to clean themselves or their living areas, the lawsuit says. Many are unresponsive, while others mutter incoherently, the lawsuit says.Photos included in the lawsuit show women huddled under blankets or, in some cases, without blankets because their bedding has been used to sop up water on the floor from leaking toilets. There are also pictures of cells strewn with trash and old food, feces and scum on shower mats, and messages written on the walls in food or feces.One of the plaintiffs, identified in the lawsuit by her initials, M.J., is 20 years old and was arrested in October on a charge of criminal trespassing, accused of proselytizing at a shopping center and refusing to leave when asked. The other, identified as K.H., is 26 and was arrested in November on charges of criminal trespassing and prowling.Both women have bonds set at $500 but remain in the jail because they can't afford to pay. The charges they face usually carry little or no jail time if convicted.They generally spend more than 23 hours a day in their cells and when they are allowed out, they spend time alone in the cell block dayroom and are deprived of meaningful social interaction and therapeutic activities, the lawsuit says. M.J. has tried to kill herself more than once, and K.H. has banged her head and face against the wall hard enough to require medical attention, the lawsuit says.The lawsuit says many other women with mental illness have deteriorated psychologically while held in prolonged solitary confinement at the jail and includes descriptions of the situations of about a dozen other women identified by their initials."It is unacceptable in our modern era to isolate people with psychiatric disabilities in solitary confinement cells," said Southern Center for Human Rights managing attorney Sarah Geraghty, who filed the lawsuit. "But to jail women charged with low-level misdemeanors in these conditions for months on end is particularly pointless and cruel."AdvertisementSupported byBy Benedict CareyDr. Lewis L. Judd, who as the country’s top mental health official helped put in place the so-called Decade of the Brain, an ambitious research agenda focused on brain biology as the key to understanding and treating psychiatric problems, died on Dec. 16 in San Diego. He was 88.His death, at an assisted-living facility, was confirmed recently by his wife, Patricia Judd, a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, of which Dr. Judd was chairman for decades. She said the cause was cardiac arrest.Dr. Judd was one of a generation of prominent psychiatrists who came to believe that the work of Freud and Jung, on which they had trained, was more art than science. Biology and genetics were the way forward, they argued, and Dr. Judd was in the right place at the right time to help make that happen.In 1987, after helping to build the U.C. San Diego psychiatry department into a leader in research, he was chosen to take over the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., the world’s largest source of funding for brain and behavior research.“At the request of Congress,” Dr. Judd said in an interview after starting the new job, “we have prepared the Decade of the Brain, a research plan designed to bring a precise and detailed understanding of all the elements of brain function within our own lifetime.”It hasn’t happened. Despite billions of dollars in federal funding and advances in tools — brain imaging, genetics, animal models — the field has yet to deliver much of practical value to psychiatrists or their patients.“The problems of understanding the underlying biology turned out to be far deeper than any of us knew when we began,” Richard Nakamura, a former official at the mental health institute who worked with Dr. Judd, said in a phone interview. But, he added, “I think Lew would take credit, justifiably, for laying the groundwork for the advances that have been made, and for the work that is still to be accomplished.”Dr. Steven E. Hyman, a later director of the institute, said in an email that “the Decade had real value for morale and public communication.” It also coincided with the publication of the first Global Burden of Disease report, Dr. Hyman added, and together the two initiatives “helped make a critical contribution in educating policymakers and the public about the public health burden of mental illness.”Other successors at the institute, including Dr. Thomas R. Insel and the current leader, Dr. Joshua A. Gordon, doubled down on Dr. Judd’s vision, steering the bulk of the funding to brain biology at the expense of behavioral approaches to mental health problems like talk and family-based therapies.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Lewis Lund Judd was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 10, 1930, the first of two sons of Dr. George Ezra Judd, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Emmeline (Lund) Judd, a homemaker. His younger brother, Howard, also a doctor, died in 2007. Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters — Stephanie Judd, a psychologist; Catherine Judd, a professor of English at the University of Miami; and Allison Fee, an occupational therapist — and five grandchildren.After graduating from Harvard School, a Los Angeles boys’ prep school (now part of the coeducational Harvard-Westlake School), Dr. Judd entered the University of Utah, where he completed a degree in psychology in 1954. He studied medicine at George Washington University and at the University of California, Los Angeles, finishing his medical degree in 1958. He completed his internship and a residency in psychiatry at U.C.L.A. After a stint in the military as base psychiatrist at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y., he joined the U.C.L.A. psychiatry faculty.In 1970, Dr. Arnold J. Mandell, the founding chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of California, San Diego, recruited Dr. Judd. The two built the department from the ground up, making it a leader in federal research funding. It was while consulting on an outside program to help adolescents with drug problems that Dr. Judd met a social worker, Patricia Hoffman, whom he married.Dr. Judd became department chairman in 1977 and, after three years as head of the N.I.M.H., returned to U.C. San Diego. He remained there for 36 years and became a recognizable public face in brain science. He also maintained a small clinical practice, specializing in treating severe depression.AdvertisementSupported byletterA social worker says outrage at the cost of Zulresso should be balanced by hope for more affordable treatments.To the Editor:Re “Can a Drug Stop Postpartum Depression?,” by Elisa Albert and Jennifer Block (Op-Ed, March 25):We do not completely understand the etiology of postpartum depression.Those of us in the trenches with moms who suffer deeply know only too well that our best efforts to understand and prevent postpartum depression do not always prevent it.

Where do my loyalties lie?By Amy BarnhorstDr. Barnhorst is a psychiatrist. SACRAMENTO — The police picked the teenager up from his high school after a terrified classmate told her principal he had threatened to slit her throat. The classmate showed them his Instagram account, where he had posted pictures of the Charleston church gunman with the word “hero” underneath it, and a picture of their school captioned “Columbine 2.0.” The officers didn’t find any guns or explosives in his house, and couldn’t arrest him for the threat, because the girl was too scared to be interviewed. So they brought him in to our mental health crisis unit for an evaluation.My job was to see if he needed to be hospitalized and treated for a mental illness. But the first question out of my mouth was a totally unprofessional one.“Which school?”As a physician, my loyalty is to my patients: listening to their stories, helping them choose medications, then getting them home to their families. But when that patient is a potential school shooter, my loyalties get complicated.I have two teenage daughters in schools nearby. Intruder drills are just another thread woven into the fabric of their childhood. I imagine when they hear the intercom announcement, their primary reaction is glee at getting out of a math quiz. I picture them huddled under their desks, giggling with their friends.And then sometimes flashes of the real thing creep in. My daughters at the picnic tables at lunch, their hair shining in the sun. How quickly their heads snap up at the first loud crack, and that frozen second of silence before the terror sets in. Everyone scattering in chaotic efforts to escape, to hide, to live. My daughters have done the drills, but they don’t know how to survive a massacre. Worse than the noise and the blood must be the realization that the adults can’t help you, that you are never safe.I can’t dwell on this alternate reality; I have things to do. So as soon as those images start to come, I build a wall in my mind to keep them at bay. Then I go on with the questions that are relevant to my assessment.The young man answered no to almost everything I asked: He hadn’t been in a psychiatric hospital before, he didn’t hear voices, he wasn’t suicidal, he didn’t intend to actually do anything at his school. He seemed unfazed by the implications of his words and his posts, and by the sudden and extensive multiagency investigation into his entire life. The F.B.I. found a “dark web” browser he had downloaded onto his computer to buy a gun on the black market. Police officers discovered his kill list in his locker; his mom was one of the first names.Like most psychiatrists, I pride myself on my ability to maintain a level of compassionate neutrality with my patients. When a patient throws coffee on my shirt because the voices told her to, I just put a sweater on and increase her medication. My job is to get people better and get them back home. But with this patient, my instinct was to lock him away indefinitely.It’s hard to do that through the mental health system. Involuntary commitment requires that a judge agree that the person is dangerous because of a mental illness. Even then, the hospitalization is usually limited to a few weeks. And this teenager didn’t exactly seem mentally ill, just off. He certainly had symptoms shared by other mass shooters: anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, paranoia, narcissism and features of autism. But he didn’t fit the description of any single diagnosis, nor was there a treatment anyone thought would cure him of his violent fantasies. All he had to do was convince the judge that he was only kidding, and he would probably be released.But this was not long after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and no one was in the mood for jokes. The judge agreed that he should be held for 14 days while we continued observing him. The law allows for a longer hold if a patient is too delusional or disorganized to manage his food, clothing and shelter, but this patient had no trouble with that. As his discharge date crept closer, our best hope was for law enforcement to show up and arrest him. But the detectives had a lot of interviews left to do, and the dark-web browser history to sort through, before they could bring any charges. They were counting on psychiatric treatment to dissipate the threat. So finally we turned to a rarely used statute in California that allowed us to keep him for up to six months because he posed a danger. In 10 years, I remember it being used only once before. It requires a higher standard of proof than the usual commitment, and if the patient requests a trial, a 12-member jury has to agree that he is enough of a threat to justify being held involuntarily for so long.  His public defender, his psychiatrists and the detectives investigating his case decided it was worth pursuing. If nothing else, it would give us more time to come up with a plan to maximize the supervision he would have in the community after he left. It has been six months, and so far it seems to be working. We arranged for intensive outpatient services so a therapist could go see him every day, and he checks in weekly with a mental health court. He finished his high school diploma online and now works while attending community college. For the first time, he has friends. He lives in a group home a few miles from my family. I’ve written before that the mental health system can’t stop mass shooters. Neither can law enforcement. But this patient’s story gave me hope. Potentially dangerous people usually fall into the gap between the systems, a gap deepened by patient privacy laws and the information firewalls they foster. There is typically little communication between doctors and law enforcement to plan for their discharge. But this time we were able to close the gap between the hospital and the courts by weaving a net of support that connected them, and connected our patient.I send my children to school every day as though nothing bad will ever happen to them.

Screen use was particularly disruptive:When the lights were onIn a dark roomAdvertisementSupported byBy Isabella KwaiSYDNEY, Australia — The Australian government said on Sunday that the last remaining children held on the Pacific island of Nauru while seeking asylum would be resettled in the United States, a long-awaited end to a controversial practice and a victory for migrant advocates.“Every asylum-seeker child has now been removed from Nauru or has had their claim processed and has a clear path off the island,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Immigration Minister David Coleman said in a joint statement.The move is a milestone for a coalition of lawyers, doctors and caseworkers who have pushed the government to transfer all critically ill people held in offshore detainment facilities to Australia. Currently, asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by sea are barred from settling there.Since 2013, more than 3,000 refugees and asylum seekers have been detained on Nauru and Manus Island, which is part of Papua New Guinea. About 1,000 such migrants remain on the islands.As of November, at least 430 refugees have been resettled in the United States, according to American officials, under a deal brokered by President Barack Obama to accept up to 1,250 refugees.The deal was thrown into doubt after the election of Donald J. Trump, who made harsh rhetoric against immigration a central theme of his presidential campaign. Weeks after being sworn in as president, he called the pact “dumb” on Twitter. But Australia said he had agreed to honor the deal.As of August, 109 children on Nauru were seeking asylum. Last year, doctors raised the alarm that a mental health crisis was coming to a head there: Children were exhibiting signs of resignation syndrome, a mental health condition found in trauma victims that involves extreme withdrawal from reality.MANUSISLANDNAURUPAPUANEW GUINEAAUSTRALIAPacific OceanSydneyNEW ZEALAND1000 milesBy The New York TimesWith children as young as 8 making references to harming themselves and refusing to eat, some were medically evacuated to Australia for emergency treatment.At least 92 children needed legal intervention before the government allowed them to seek urgent care, the National Justice Project, a nonprofit organization representing many of the children, said in a statement.“Don’t be fooled by any government claims that getting kids off Nauru is their win,” Jana Favero, the director of advocacy and campaigns at the Asylum Seeker Resource Center, said in an interview. “We’ve had to fight the government every step of the way to get kids transferred.”While pleased with the successful effort to remove the children from Nauru, the group is still “deeply concerned” about those remaining in the detention centers, she added.Since 2014, 12 people have died in detention, many from self-harm.In its statement, the government said it was working “quietly and methodically” to remove the children while maintaining the “integrity” of the current migration policy.“We have secured our borders; we stopped the boats and the tragic drownings at sea,” the government said.Parliament is to resume next week to debate a contentious bill in the House of Representatives that would allow all sick persons on the islands to be temporarily transferred to Australia.“The bill provides the only pathway for critically ill people to get the treatment they urgently need.” Ms. Favero said.AdvertisementSupported byHe works in advertising. By Jonah Engel Bromwich and Sapna MaheshwariWhen Chris Godfrey learned in early January that the record for “likes” on an Instagram post was held by the celebrity and businesswoman Kylie Jenner, he took it as a challenge. He remembers thinking: “Could something as universal and simple as an egg be great enough to beat that record?”It could! Just nine days after the thought, that record was cracked. Mr. Godfrey had beaten Ms. Jenner’s post about her infant daughter with a simple picture of an egg. The original egg post now has more than 52 million likes — her post is shy of 19 million — and the egg’s account now has more than 10 million followers.Why an egg? Mr. Godfrey explained: “An egg has no gender, race or religion. An egg is an egg, it’s universal.” Mr. Godfrey, a 29-year-old advertising creative who works at the & Partnership in London, and the two friends he has enlisted to help him with the account have now delivered their second act. It is a commercial produced with and aired on the streaming service Hulu, timed to take advantage of the annual Super Bowl ad extravaganza. In it, the egg shares a story about how going viral has affected its mental health.“The pressure of social media is getting to me,” the egg discloses in the commercial, after introducing itself. “If you’re struggling, too, talk to someone.”The ad then directs viewers to the website for the nonprofit Mental Health America. The creators say that mental health is the first of several causes that the egg — which they and their fans call Eugene — will come to stand for.“People have fallen in love with this egg, and Eugene the egg wants to continue to spread positive messages,” said Alissa Khan-Whelan, 26, one of the friends working with Mr. Godfrey.After the birth of the egg on Jan. 4, Mr. Godfrey stayed anonymous. But he, Ms. Khan-Whelan and another friend, C.J. Brown, 29, agreed to speak to The New York Times to tell their story and explain their intentions. “We felt that the time was right to come out,” Ms. Khan-Whelan said. “We can put any speculation to bed.”There has been a lot of puzzlement about how a picture of an egg created an Instagram frenzy. Some speculated that the account’s creator had paid influencers to spread the word. Others even took credit for growing the egg’s audience.Mr. Godfrey says that such claims are untrue and that the account’s growth was “completely organic.” No one person helped the egg’s rise in popularity and no single account or group of accounts helped it to explode.They did note a demographic that embraced the egg immediately.“I think it was perhaps the younger generation,” Mr. Godfrey said. “In the schools and stuff, it started to spread. It sort of spread through playgrounds.” He noticed that interactions with young people would peak between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, “when school was out.”Ms. Khan-Whelan recalled seeing “amazing videos of kids in their class going ‘Miss, miss, have you liked the egg?’”Marketers agreed that the youth had been key to the egg’s success. (Instagram technically requires users to be 13 to create an account, but that rule is often disregarded.) Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of the agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners, only became aware of the egg account after realizing that her 12-year-old son had liked the image. She then sought out more information about it.“What a great thing for them to do and kind of hijack the Super Bowl through social, and hammer home a responsible message,” she said.The egg’s audience was also amplified by Mr. Godfrey’s decision to incorporate user-generated content into the account’s Instagram stories, where posts expire after 24 hours. The egg’s main Instagram feed stayed spare and mysterious, while Mr. Godfrey shouted out followers in its stories, helping to infect his growing audience with a sense of team spirit. (The hashtag #EggGang was quickly adapted to describe the account’s fans.)“In its infancy, it was one of those ridiculous things, like, ‘Oh, we’re trying to break this world record by just liking this random image,’” said Sam Shepherd, an executive creative director at the digital agency 360i. That agency won industry praise in 2013 when it worked with Oreo to quickly tweet “You can still dunk in the dark” during an unexpected blackout at the Super Bowl. Mr. Shepherd described the egg’s next act as the 2019 version of that stunt.The team behind the egg declined to talk about the money it has been offered or the big names it has come into contact with, preferring to keep the attention focused on Eugene. (Asked about one marketer’s claim that partnering with the account would be worth at least $10 million, Ms. Khan-Whelan said only that the number was “greatly exaggerated.”)It is true, though, that building an entity — really, a platform on a platform — that reaches millions of people brings financial benefit. The egg team is being paid by Hulu. It said that Nick Tran, Hulu’s vice president of brand marketing and culture, pursued the opportunity, and that he was introduced to them though The Times, a new agency in Chicago created by the Instagram enthusiast Jason Peterson. It would not disclose what it was paid.“Dollars always follow eyeballs,” said Andrew Essex, chief executive and founder of Plan A, a creative holding company. For the creators, the account’s success was “basically a license to print money,” he said.Mr. Godfrey, Mr. Brown and Ms. Khan-Whelan say they are less interested in money than in promoting positivity.“We’ve had plenty of amazing offers and opportunities that have come on to the table,” Ms. Khan-Whelan said. “So many. We’ve not really been sharing details because we don’t think this is about us. This is about Eugene the egg and what the egg can do.”Mr. Godfrey would not comment on what the last few weeks had been like, other than to say it had been “crazy” and “a real journey.” (He, Mr. Brown and Ms. Khan-Whelan have essentially been living together, in South East London, for that time.)“It’s not really about me,” he insisted. “It’s just about the egg and sort of where we can take it and what we can do with it.”They would not comment on the causes they will support beyond mental health, saying that they would take each day as it comes. They plan to remain highly responsive to their audience.“The fact that they were able to get a lot of people to look at a picture of the egg — it was the ultimate anomaly, just a complete freak event,” Mr. Essex said. “A tear in the time-space continuum. It doesn’t make much sense, but it’s not going to continue. Every once in a while something comes out of the blue and breaks the internet for no reason. This is the quintessential fluke. It’s not replicable. It’s not replicable and it’s not sustainable. With all due respect.”(Asked to whom the respect was due, he clarified: “To the egg people.”)The egg people are not dissuaded. They have heard from fans in Azerbaijan and Dubai. They are particularly popular in the United States, which is one of the reasons they decided to do a Super Bowl ad.“It’s a dream to put that in the same sentence that we’re doing something in relation to the Super Bowl — it feels really special,” Ms. Khan-Whelan said. “Michael Jackson performed at halftime, and now Eugene is center stage.”Mr. Godfrey said the team sees the Super Bowl as more than just an American event but rather as “an international moment.”“Eugene is global, Eugene is really global all over the world,” Ms. Khan-Whelan said. “He likes football. Or she, sorry. Or it.”Asked to respond to Mr. Essex, Mr. Godfrey did agree that the egg’s success had been a fluke.“But it’s a fluke that caught the world’s attention,” he said. “It’s what you do with that attention that counts.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Emily S. RuebA week ago, 10-year-old Raniya Wright was taken to the hospital, unconscious but breathing, following a fight with another student at her South Carolina elementary school. Two days later, she died.On Monday, her parents demanded answers.“I want to find out what happened, how it happened and who was involved,” her father, Jermaine Van Dyke, said at a news conference in front of Forest Hills Elementary School in Walterboro, S.C., about an hour west of Charleston.A lawyer for Ashley Wright, Raniya’s mother, said the family wanted to know whether there was “appropriate supervision in the classroom, and what, if any, steps did school administrators take to intervene in the fight.”The lawyer, Margie A. Pizarro, said Ms. Wright “trusted the school to keep Raniya safe from harm. She trusted the school to protect Raniya.”Ms. Wright did not attend Monday’s news conference, Ms. Pizarro said, because she was selecting the dress and lace gloves that her daughter will wear at Wednesday’s funeral, and the coffin that she will be buried in.In a Facebook post last week, Raniya’s mother suggested that bullying was a factor in her child’s death. She posted a photo of her kissing her daughter’s cheek, as Raniya lay in a hospital bed, wearing a neck brace and hooked up to tubes. “Stay woke PARENTS!” she wrote.Ms. Pizarro said in a statement that the family “is demanding change” in Raniya’s name.“Change that addresses the reasons that a child would openly express anxiety about attending school,” she said. “Change that addresses legitimate fears that a child has while in the school building. Change that addresses bullying and teasing and the collateral damage when those behaviors go unchecked.”The fifth grader’s death has prompted a stream of grief — as well as an investigation into the school’s handling of the episode, and debate among community members and state lawmakers about how to handle bullying in the classroom.Mark Peper, a lawyer for Mr. Van Dyke, said at the news conference on Monday that the school had “been on notice” for previous confrontations in the girl’s classroom.For years, he said, there had been “altercations occurring on a regular basis between individuals in this specific classroom.”The Colleton County Sheriff’s Office, which is leading the investigation, said the Medical University of South Carolina performed an autopsy on Friday, but it would be a few weeks before the results were released.Duffie Stone, the solicitor for the 14th Judicial Circuit in South Carolina, who is assisting with the investigation, said at a news conference on Friday that it was “premature to speculate on whether there will be any criminal charges stemming from this incident.”Reached by phone on Monday, Mr. Stone said the investigation was continuing, but did not provide further details.In a statement released on Friday, Sean Gruber, a spokesman for the Colleton County School District, said the school was cooperating fully with the investigation.“We will continue to be transparent with our students, staff, parents, and the community and are eager for the facts to be released,” he said.Mr. Gruber did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.The other student involved in the episode has been suspended until the investigation is completed, according to the Colleton County School District’s website. The school is bringing in additional staff members to provide counseling and support.Last year, the elementary school had about 50 student behavior incidents that led to out-of-school suspensions, according to data provided by district officials.The recent episode “sheds a light” on the challenges legislators and school districts across the state are facing, said State Representative Marvin R. Pendarvis, a Democrat.“Bullying is real,” he said. “We have to recognize it and we have to do something about it.”Mr. Pendarvis said he was a co-sponsor of measures that address the root causes of bullying with mental health education and additional counseling to ensure “students have someone to talk to.”Other state legislators have proposed measures that address how schools report and investigate bullying. More immediately, he said, the state plans to increase the number of mental health professionals in schools.In recent days, a makeshift memorial by the school’s sign has swelled with pink stuffed animals and shiny heart- and star-shaped balloons. Nearly 2,000 people donated to a GoFundMe campaign for Ms. Wright.Last Thursday, after a three-hour meeting held by the Colleton County School Board, hundreds of community members held hands, sang and bowed their heads during a prayer vigil in a Walterboro park at sundown. Attendees painted signs on car windows that said, “Unite against bullies.”One woman told a local NBC station she was determined to see the school take action.AdvertisementSupported byBy Iliana MagraLONDON — English schools will significantly broaden sex and relationship education to cover topics including same-sex relationships, transgender people, menstruation, sexual assault, mental health, genital cutting, forced marriage, pornography and sexting, the government has announced.The changes, the first revision of the sex education curriculum since 2000, have met with vocal opposition from some parents and religious schools that want the ability to opt out of elements they object to. But they formally became government policy when they were published on Monday, and will go into effect in September 2020.“There is no set of guidance that you can come up with for relationship and sex education that everybody’s going to be absolutely happy with,” Damian Hinds, Britain’s education secretary, said in Parliament on Monday, after announcing the revisions.“Our guiding principles have been that these compulsory subjects should help to keep children safe, should help to prepare them for the world in which they’re growing up,” he added, and also “help them foster respect for others and for difference.”Parents would have the ability to exclude their children from some elements, including the most explicitly sexual, but not others, and not after age 14, said Mr. Hinds, a member of the Conservative government. From age 15, it will up to the student to decide whether to participate fully.The curriculum developed by Britain’s central government will be mandatory for any school in England that receives government funds, including religious schools; it was drafted under a 2017 law instructing the government to update the policy. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have separate standards.An online petition asking for parents to be given broader power to opt out had gathered more than 100,000 signatures by Monday morning, prompting Parliament to debate the matter — an airing of views that did not affect the policy — while dozens of protesters gathered outside.The government was “pretty much indoctrinating the children with a specific ideology that there is no such thing as right or wrong, it’s just whatever you like basically,” said Musa Mohammed, a 32-year-old father of three who joined the protest. “These are our children — they belong to the parents, they don’t belong to the state.”Britta Riby-Smith, a mother of three, said she was there to support “the Christian cause.”Under the new curriculum, as the children get older, “the L.G.B.T. kind of agenda becomes stronger,” she said. “This is something I want my children to know about — I don’t want them to be ignorant, definitely not — but I would like to teach them about this myself.”But Helen Jones, a Labour lawmaker, insisted in Parliament that the new program did not advocate any particular set of views, but was designed to prepare children to deal with the world as it is.“Young people who receive good relationship and sex education are less likely to form early sexual relationships, less likely to have an unwanted pregnancy, less likely to get pregnant early, and less likely to get a sexually transmitted disease,” she said.Some women’s health advocates had specifically campaigned for teaching about menstrual health, arguing that girls were often unaware of the signs of painful or dangerous conditions.Jessica Ringrose, a professor of sociology of gender and education at University College London, called the curriculum promising, saying in an interview, “It will be really great if they will be able to tackle all these issues.”Sex education already exists in most English schools, but under the 2000 policy, the curriculum is more limited and more geared toward secondary schools, and much of it is not mandatory. Children generally begin secondary school at age 11.The new standards include mandatory primary and secondary school education on what makes a healthy or unhealthy relationship, part of an expanded focus on physical and mental health. Basic sex education late in primary school is recommended but not required.The secondary sex education curriculum includes new topics like the fact that “there are different types of committed, stable relationships,” “what constitutes sexual harassment and sexual violence,” and that “sexually explicit material often presents a distorted picture of sexual behaviors.”“A lot of people in my position wouldn’t want to say anything,” Marquette guard Markus Howard, the Big East player of the year, said of going public about seeking mental health counseling.CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York TimesSupported byBy Pat BorziMILWAUKEE — The image of Markus Howard on the wall of the Marquette basketball meeting room seems perfect. It shows Howard, the Golden Eagles’ leading scorer and one of the most dynamic players in the Big East Conference, in the middle of a team huddle. All eyes are on him, his stature and his leadership unquestioned.Marquette (24-8) pulled out of its four-game losing streak with an 86-54 rout of St. John’s (21-12) n Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden behind 30 points from Howard. For his team to continue to advance, Howard, who on Wednesday was named the Big East’s player of the year, will need to keep making his assortment of fallback jumpers, 3-pointers and twisting drives to the basket. That is the basketball burden Howard, a 5-foot-11 junior guard, carries onto the court. But it is not why the image on the wall makes him uncomfortable.“A lot of what I want to be remembered for here at Marquette is not for what I’ve done on the court, but what I’ve done off,” Howard said. “I think my impact is made bigger when I do something for somebody else.”Like talking about why he sees a therapist.Marquette, like many universities, offers mental health services to students who request them. Howard, unlike many college athletes, is eager to discuss his experience.For about a year, he has been seeing a licensed clinical social worker trained in psychotherapy, someone he and his family refer to as a sports psychologist. That suggests someone versed in the mental side of athletic performance.But Howard said he sought help for balancing the daily demands of college life, managing class work and outside interests with basketball. His weekly therapy sessions are continuing, he said. With more and more athletes publicly discussing their mental health struggles, from the Olympians Michael Phelps and Gracie Gold to the N.B.A. star Kevin Love, Howard said he felt he owed it to anyone reluctant to ask for help to lend his voice as well.“A lot of people in my position wouldn’t want to say anything,” Howard said. “It’s a duty of mine, to be in the position I’m in, to be able to raise awareness of these kinds of issues going on in our sport. I would be doing a disservice to the people around me and the people in the same situation as me if I didn’t speak up.”That is not the only instance in which Howard’s leadership extends beyond basketball and his team. Together with the lacrosse player Nick Singleton, Howard founded a Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter on campus after they returned from a spring trip to build basketball courts in Costa Rica with a group of Marquette athletes. Howard is also one of two student-athletes on the 16-member N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball oversight committee.“Given all the success that he has, he still has, to me, a servant’s heart,” Coach Steve Wojciechowski said.Three years ago, Howard arrived on Marquette’s campus in Milwaukee as a 17-year-old prodigy from Chandler, Ariz., by way of the high school powerhouse Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nev. He had just won an under-17 world championship with U.S.A. Basketball.As a college freshman, he led the nation in 3-point shooting, setting a Marquette record (.547) and making the Big East’s all-freshman team. A year later he averaged 20.4 points and set Marquette’s single-game scoring record: 52 points, in an overtime victory at Providence. After the game, Friars Coach Ed Cooley described Howard as Superman.But near the end of that season, with increasing attention on his play and Marquette’s, Howard said he felt overwhelmed. His parents, Chuck and Noemi, sensed something was wrong when they visited him for a game; so did Wojciechowski and the Golden Eagles’ staff. Howard seemed quieter, more withdrawn.Chuck Howard, formerly the athletics performance director at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, figured Marquette had mental health services available for athletes. The family discussed Howard’s engaging with them with the basketball staff.“That was something we felt like would be helpful for Markus, having an outlet to talk to somebody about what he’s feeling, thinking, and all the things that are coming at him,” Wojciechowski said. “We encouraged it. We encourage anything that is going to help our guys become better people, because better people make better players.”Howard agreed.“Mainly, it’s getting how things away from the court impact me on the court,” he said. “We can see what might be causing a problem, then try to fix it to where it doesn’t even come into contact when I do start playing, so I can have a free mind when I play.“As a student-athlete, you think your life revolves around the game. That’s not the case. I want to talk about all aspects of life so I can grow in all aspects of life, not just in my sport. I feel like if I’m the best version of myself, I can give the best version of myself to other people. So I want to be able to do that on the court and off.”At times, Chuck Howard said, Markus had to be prodded to go to sessions. “Now it’s been a consistent thing for him,” Chuck Howard said. “It’s really been helpful. And he felt led to speak about it. It’s not something we pushed him to do or asked him to do. He just felt led because he saw the benefit of what it did for him.”Until the last few games, Howard has been an even better version of the player he was last year.Howard broke his single-game scoring record — and set a Big East mark — with 53 points in a 106-104 overtime victory at Creighton on Jan. 9, a game in which he made 10 3-pointers in 14 attempts. In games through Monday, Howard led the Big East and ranked sixth nationally in Division I in scoring, at 25 points a game. He was making 3.61 3-pointers a game, also sixth best, and his 90.2 free-throw percentage ranked ninth in the country.Howard honed his shooting in intense summer sessions directed by his older brother Desmond, a former college player. Their unconventional drills feature pull-up jumpers from a step inside half court, and arcing shots over folded bleachers flipped on their side. Teammates say they are used to Howard’s creativity.“Playing with him is kind of crazy, in a good way,” forward Sam Hauser said. “Sometimes he gets that look in his eye where you just have to give him the ball and watch him work, work his magic. It’s cool to see where he’s grown and where he can still grow.”AdvertisementSupported byAmanda Helena Freyre and Michael John Martinez were married Feb. 16 at the St. Patrick Catholic Church in Miami Beach.

To the Editor:Re “9 Last-Minute Valentine’s Day Ideas” (nytimes.com, Feb. 11):Valentine’s Day is a day scarred for us all. It marks our collective failure to do our most basic duty: protect our children. It is impossible to go through this day with stuffed bears, chocolates and improv comedy when 17 beautiful lives were taken away on Valentine’s Day last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. We have failed to protect our children’s lives, time and time again. We failed those children in Parkland. We failed the 20 precious young lives in Sandy Hook. We failed the 12 beloved teenagers in Columbine. They will never send a Candygram or get a love letter from a high school crush. They will never have a little son or daughter hand them a homemade, heart-shaped card with scrawlings of love. Valentine’s Day is a time for activism, for us to do our basic duty of forcing our leaders, our businesses and ourselves to enact laws that stop children from being murdered. Improve campus safety. Strengthen mental health supports and screenings. Enact responsible firearms laws.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressBLOOMINGTON, Minn. — A 5-year-old boy who was thrown from a third-floor balcony at the Mall of America near Minneapolis remains hospitalized with serious injuries, authorities said Saturday.Bloomington police Chief Jeffrey Potts said during a news conference that the boy fell nearly 40 feet after a man who apparently didn't know the boy or his family threw him off the balcony Friday. Authorities haven't released the boy's name and say his family has requested privacy.Potts said he couldn't give an update on the boy's status, except to say that he's being cared for at the hospital and that his parents are with him. Hospital officials haven't responded to requests for a status update.Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, of Minneapolis, was arrested at the mall's transit station after the attack and is jailed on a suspicion of attempted homicide charge. Potts credited bystanders and mall security for his quick capture."This is a horrific situation," Potts said.Potts said investigators don't believe Aranda knew the boy's family and do not have a motive.A witness, Brian Johnson, told WCCO-TV on Friday that he heard a woman scream that her child had been thrown from the balcony. He said she was screaming, "Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge."Court records show that Aranda has a history of convictions for misdemeanor offense. He was charged in two previous incidents at the mall in 2015. Potts said some of those cases were handled through mental health court, but he didn't elaborate. At one point, Aranda had a trespass notice banning him from the mall, but it was no longer in effect, Potts said.AdvertisementSupported byCalculatorIs your health important to you? Then consider moving to one of these 10 places.By Michael KolomatskyMaintaining a healthy lifestyle is easier in some neighborhoods than others. But which ones?To determine the healthiest places to live in New York City, StreetEasy recently analyzed data from its listings, along with information from Yelp and the city’s Open Data portal.For each neighborhood, the company considered the number and availability of bike rooms and bike lanes; gyms, pools and other fitness facilities; medical offices and health centers; and parks, community gardens and athletic fields. (All of the information was weighted per capita, and neighborhoods with fewer than 3,000 residents were excluded.)The company also partnered with Seamless, the takeout-food app, to find out which areas had the most restaurants that would accommodate requests for healthy food — things like specifying brown rice over white. Not surprisingly, most of the top 10 neighborhoods on the list were in the outer boroughs. Parks and open space were a big part of the reason, and the relative affordability was no doubt a mental-health bonus.Red Hook, BrooklynMost feet of bike lanes per capitaLong Island City, QueensHighest rate of healthy takeout requestsOakland Gardens, QueensAmount of park space per person (670 square feet)Dumbo, BrooklynPlentiful gyms and bike storage in residential buildings; brown rice ordered 2.4 times more than whiteFlatiron, ManhattanThe most fitness studios and gyms per capitaMidtown, ManhattanMany health and wellness centers, gyms and fitness studiosBrooklyn Heights, BrooklynThe most residential buildings with bike roomsRiverdale, BronxMany residential buildings catering to healthy lifestylesDouglaston, QueensLots of park space per capita and restaurants fulfilling healthy requestsMott Haven, BronxHealthy restaurant orders 51 percent above city averageRed Hook, BrooklynMost feet of bike lanes per capitaLong Island City, QueensHighest rate of healthy takeout requestsOakland Gardens, QueensAmount of park space per person (670 square feet)Dumbo, BrooklynPlentiful gyms and bike storage in residential buildings; brown rice ordered 2.4 times more than whiteFlatiron, ManhattanThe most fitness studios and gyms per capitaMidtown, ManhattanMany health and wellness centers, gyms and fitness studiosBrooklyn Heights, BrooklynThe most residential buildings with bike roomsRiverdale, BronxMany residential buildings catering to healthy lifestylesDouglaston, QueensLots of park space per capita and restaurants fulfilling healthy requestsMott Haven, BronxHealthy restaurant orders 51 percent above city averageSource: StreetEasyAdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - The man accused of seriously injuring a 5-year-old boy by throwing him from a balcony at Minnesota's Mall of America last week told investigators he had initially intended to kill an adult, but it did not "work out," prosecutors said on Monday.Emmanuel Aranda, who police said has a history of mental issues and arrests on relatively minor charges, went to the mall last Thursday and left without following through on his plan, the Hennepin County Attorney's office said. Aranda told investigators he returned to the mall on Friday still intending to kill an adult, but picked the boy instead, and admitted throwing him from the building's third tier, the attorney's office said in a complaint."(Aranda) acknowledged repeatedly in his interview that he had planned and intended to kill someone at the mall that day and that he was aware that what he was doing was wrong," prosecutors said in a complaint filed with Hennepin County District Court.Aranda said years of coming to the mall to try talk to women only to be rejected "caused him to lash out and be aggressive," according to the complaint. Police have not identified the boy, but said he suffered life-threatening injuries after falling nearly 40 feet (12 meters) at the Bloomington mall, a major tourist attraction in the state. Prosecutors said he remained in critical condition on Monday.MORE THAN $600,000 RAISEDIn a GoFundMe post that raised $617,000 for the child's medical expenses by Monday afternoon, a family friend identified as Noah Hanneman of Woodbury, Minnesota, said the boy's first name is Landen. Aranda, 24, of Minneapolis, will face attempted premeditated first-degree murder charges when he appears in court on Tuesday, and prosecutors will ask that bail be set at $2 million, the complaint said."We charged Mr. Aranda with the most severe crime that the evidence allowed," Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement. After throwing the boy from the balcony, Aranda fled the scene but was arrested elsewhere at the mall a short time later, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said on Friday.Aranda had been arrested by Bloomington police three times in 2015, including once after he threw an object from the third level at the mall, Potts told reporters on Saturday.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCOLLEGE PARK, Md. — A Maryland police department has concluded that its officer was justified in fatally shooting a man during a confrontation captured on body camera video, a police chief said in a memo released Wednesday.Montgomery County Police began the administrative investigation after prosecutors ruled out any criminal charges against Officer Anand Badgujar in the June 2018 shooting. Ultimately, the department found that his use of deadly force against Robert White, a 41-year-old black man, was "lawful and justified."Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said in a memo dated March 26 that body camera recording shows White escalated the situation by attacking Badgujar and "putting him in grave danger."Video from another officer's body camera shows the officer backpedaling away from White, who assaulted Badgujar before the officer fired one round, according to the chief."Mr. White got up quickly and stood over the officer, who appeared to be in a sitting position on the ground," the chief wrote. "Mr. White is seen on the video holding the officer down while punching him in the head."The officer believed White was trying to grab his gun after knocking him down, the chief added."When Mr. White continued assaulting the officer, Officer Badgujar believed his life was in danger," the chief wrote. "Based on the actions of Mr. White in the video, there is ample evidence that Officer Badgujar was in danger of serious bodily harm which would lawfully justify his use of deadly force."White didn't brandish a weapon, but police say investigators found a folding knife in his right front pocket.The deadly encounter happened in a parking lot outside a townhouse development in Silver Spring, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Authorities released body camera footage that August.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCOLUMBIA, S.C. — A shooting inside a South Carolina hospital on Thursday left both a police officer and the suspected gunman wounded, authorities said, in what was the second shooting inside a hospital in the state in two days.The Thursday shooting happened around 2 a.m., when 27-year-old Kevin Boyce Patterson was spotted with a gun, visiting the emergency room at the Laurens County Memorial Hospital in Clinton, authorities said.An arrest warrant issued Thursday night said Patterson dragged his father at gunpoint across the waiting room. When a Greenville Health Authority Police Department officer and a state trooper started to ask the man questions, he shot the police officer and tried to run, said Sarah Moore, a spokeswoman for Prisma Health, which runs the hospital.The officer fired back, hitting Boyce in the arm, investigators said.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division charged Boyce with attempted murder, kidnapping and pointing and presenting a firearm. He was booked in the Laurens County jail. Records did not indicate whether he had a lawyer who could comment.Moore said the police officer was treated and released. The officer's name was not released as of Thursday.The shooting in Laurens County happened a day after a nurse was shot in a hospital emergency room in Orangeburg. According to a police report, 23-year-old Abrian Dayquan Sabb came to the Regional Medical Center with a long gun and shot the nurse in the abdomen Wednesday morning.A hospital security guard had Sabb in custody by the time the first Orangeburg County deputies arrived three minutes later, a police report said. Sabb had come to the center just a day before, along with family members who were trying to get him mental health treatment.State Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter said Wednesday that the family was told to come back because there weren't enough treatment beds.Before the hospital shooting, deputies said they encountered Sabb after his girlfriend called 911 to report that he had fired a gun while she tried to take it from him. The officers gave the gun to Sabb's father, according to the police report.The gun used in the hospital shooting Wednesday appeared to have been stolen from a nearby home just minutes earlier, deputies said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Charlotte Graham-McLayCHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been the sunny face of New Zealand, celebrated as the nation’s youngest leader in 150 years, the one who gave birth in office and brought her baby to the floor of the United Nations. At 38, she’s pitched progressive politics and her nation’s charms to Stephen Colbert and the “Today” show. Vogue magazine called her the “anti-Trump.”Now, with the massacre of 50 people at two mosques by a gunman espousing anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant hatred, Ms. Ardern is back in the international spotlight, but the glamour is gone. Instead, she speaks for New Zealand at a moment of national pain, her vision of kindness in politics tested by the worst mass murder in her country’s modern history.“We represent diversity, kindness, compassion. A home for those who share our values. Refuge for those who need it,” she told reporters at Parliament as the horror of the shootings began to unfold on Friday, her words broadcast around the world even as the killer’s video and manifesto of hatred were spreading online. Ms. Ardern herself had been emailed a copy of the manifesto minutes before the massacre began.“You may have chosen us,” she said of the gunman, “but we utterly reject and condemn you.”That sentiment has echoed across New Zealand in the aftermath of the shootings. In a country of less than five million people, prized for its safety and natural beauty, people had the same refrain: Things like this do not happen here.On Saturday, thousands attended vigils and visited makeshift memorials around the country. They expressed disbelief on social media, using the hashtag #TheyAreUs to embrace the Muslim community.In Auckland, the largest city, a gathering in Aotea Square opened with a prayer for Muslims and others discriminated against around the world before the crowd sang “Stand by Me,” local news media reported. In the capital, Wellington, lampposts near the city’s largest mosque were plastered with signs.“Love and solidarity to our Muslim whanau,” the posters read, using the indigenous Maori word for family. “No room for racism here.”In Christchurch, where the massacre occurred, the tragedy drew together unlikely allies. Members of rival New Zealand gangs stood in solidarity outside Hagley College, where relatives of those dead, injured or missing gathered to console one another.“We’re here to show our support and our love,” said Karnz Vercoe, part of a group of former gang members called Tu Tangata.President Trump, who was mentioned as a source of inspiration in the manifesto believed to have been posted by the gunman, condemned the killings and called them a “horrible, disgraceful thing.” Asked by a reporter if he saw white nationalism as a rising threat around the world, Mr. Trump said: “I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess.”Ms. Ardern recounted on Saturday her own conversation with Mr. Trump after the attack. “He asked what support the United States could provide,” she said. “My message was: sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.”She said she had “conveyed the sentiment that I think exists here.”Aware that the eyes of the world are on New Zealand, many see Ms. Ardern as their representative for processing and reacting to the news.“Given the situation, I really don’t think anyone could do much better,” said Jordan Teheuheu, 21, who stopped at a makeshift memorial in Christchurch. “In our time of need, we need people who show who we are.”But Ms. Ardern, who took office in 2017, faces great challenges. She has promised to overhaul New Zealand’s gun laws in the wake of the attacks, though she has yet to say how and gun-rights supporters have pushed back.The Kiwi Gun Blog, an online publication, said that among the mosque shooter’s goals, one was “to cause the gun rights of responsible New Zealanders to be attacked.” It said “our prime minister is now capitulating.”A former race relations commissioner, Susan Devoy, has also called on the government to start counting instances of hate crimes, suggesting they are more common than New Zealanders like to think.“There can be no other response if we are serious about learning anything from the murders of our innocent people this week,” Ms. Devoy said.After speaking to the nation from the capital on Friday, Ms. Ardern flew to Christchurch on Saturday, accompanied by lawmakers from across the political spectrum.She was somber, dressed in black. At a meeting with Muslim leaders, for which she wore a black head scarf, Ms. Ardern asked those present what they would like her to do.“Our time is for you to determine,” she told the leaders. They wanted her to meet families of the victims, and she did.Christchurch, a city of 375,000, has faced tragedy before: It was rocked by major earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, demolishing much of the central city. The February 2011 quake killed 185 people.The city’s mental health services are still stretched to the breaking point. Just last month, Ms. Ardern promised $54 million for mental health treatment in Christchurch.Lynette Hardie Wills said people “are still suffering” after the quakes. Eight years later, she is waiting for repairs to her badly damaged home.AdvertisementSupported byBy Matt StevensA white man who shot three young black men who had been trying to evacuate in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina died just days after being sentenced to 10 years in prison for the crimes, the authorities said Wednesday.The man, Roland J. Bourgeois Jr., 56, died Feb. 19 — five days after his sentencing — at a jail in Louisiana while he was in the custody of the United States Marshals Service, Walter Martin, a supervisory deputy, said. Mr. Bourgeois had been awaiting a transfer to a federal prison.The Plaquemines Parish Sheriff’s Office is handling the death investigation, Mr. Martin added. The cause of death was not immediately clear, but Mr. Martin said the authorities did not suspect foul play.Federal prosecutors had cited Mr. Bourgeois’s physical and mental health as one reason his court proceedings dragged on for nearly nine years after he was initially indicted. During that time, Mr. Bourgeois was repeatedly found incompetent to stand trial. He was eventually declared competent in 2018.Shortly after the hurricane ravaged New Orleans in 2005, Mr. Bourgeois fired a shotgun at the three men because they were black and had entered the neighborhood in which he lived, the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Louisiana had said. The men, who were all injured in the shooting, had been trying to reach a ferry landing that state and federal agencies were using as an evacuation site.In 2010, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Bourgeois with five felony counts, and the maximum penalty was life in prison. Prosecutors later dismissed the original indictment as part of a plea agreement, and in October, Mr. Bourgeois pleaded guilty to two counts: interference with the rights of the men he targeted and use of a firearm during a violent crime.On Feb. 14, he was sentenced to five years in prison on each of the two counts. He was also sentenced to five years of supervised release.Julia Jacobs contributed reporting.AdvertisementSupported byTeenagers in The TimesBy The Learning NetworkBelow, the February 2019 edition of Teenagers in The Times.

Here is a brief summary:UNDERSTAFFING AND OVERCROWDING— Staff and electronically monitor the perimeters and screen anyone entering facilities.— Consult with an approved expert on the feasibility of realigning low-risk, nonviolent inmates to local oversight.— Hire 500 additional corrections officers in prisons in the short-term, but by 2020 bring staffing in compliance with a judge's orders in an ongoing prison mental health lawsuit. The judge has said the state will need to add as many as 2,000 or more officers by 2022.— Work with federal experts to assess the skills and continued leadership of all wardens.VIOLENCE— Stop subjecting victims to discipline for unrelated conduct when they seek help or protection from harm.— Provide remedial security training to all correctional staff.— Conduct documented security rounds in all living areas at least once every hour, every half-hour with special management populations and even more frequently with prisoners on suicide watch.— Develop a centralized autopsy system, assess for trends and correct problems.CONTRABAND— Shake down at least 15% of housing units every day. Search all group areas weekly and other areas daily, documenting the results and addressing patterns.— Ensure every entrance to every facility has a working metal detector, with a procedure to use them on everyone coming in.— Consult with an approved expert on other ways of detecting illegal drugs and other contraband, and change screening methods accordingly.— Provide adequate evidence-based medical treatment for all prisoners detoxifying as illegal drugs are eliminated.SEXUAL ABUSE— Avoid subjecting victims to discipline when they seek help because of threatened or actual sexual abuse.— Bring in professionals to investigate and properly document every allegation of sexual abuse.— Hire an approved, nationally recognized expert on prison rapes to suggest immediate and long-term remedies— Reclassify every prisoner to ensure potential predators are separated from potential victims.FACILITY CONDITIONS— Identify all the broken locks and repair them.— Ensure at least 80% of each prison's toilets, sinks and showerheads work.AdvertisementSupported byI’d heard that people who were abused as children often abuse their own kids.

I recognized the shade of her ash brown eyebrows and the faint purple thread veins crisscrossing her cheeks.It was like unexpectedly seeing someone from the past I’d rather not remember. The last time I had seen that face in person was in the mirror of my childhood home.In that home, any minor annoyance could set off a frightening rampage. I was abused by a parent who left bruises on my wrists when I was 5 years old after I accidentally scratched my younger sister’s finger during a game. When I didn’t hang up the dog’s collar in exactly the right position, I was threatened with being choked by it.When I looked down at my baby, I realized that my parents must have once looked down at me nestled in much the same way and seen a similar face. And then one of them abused me for the next 15 years.It’s a shibboleth among child abuse survivors that we’re at higher risk of abusing our own children. In the past, studies suggested that about one-third of child abuse survivors become abusers, too, transmitting our trauma to our descendants. On one side of my family, I can trace our lineage of child abuse back at least four generations to my great-grandmother, whose father is said to have once struck her on the head so hard that her ear bled on the opposite side.In 2015, a study published in Science used 30 years of child protective service agency records and reports from parents and children to debunk the old idea that parents who were physically abused as children are more likely to physically abuse their kids. Researchers did find that the children of child abuse victims were more likely to be neglected or sexually abused. However, the study author, Cathy Spatz Widom, pointed out that the use of data from child protective services may have picked up neglect and sexual abuse cases that are overlooked in the general population.“What we found was that it was not inevitable, not deterministic, not the majority of these cases,” Dr. Widom said in an interview for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “It has this important message that you shouldn’t—one shouldn’t, if you have a history, that you shouldn’t necessarily feel that you’re bound to continue in this cycle of maltreatment.”The violence in my family stopped when my parents separated, when I was 15. At that time, I thought of healing as a discrete task with a definite endpoint, a line item I could check off on my mental health to-do list. I hoped I would be officially healed one day, and serenity would fall over the rest of my life like a quiet, steady snow.Instead, every major milestone has the potential to touch off a new aftershock. Many child abuse survivors grapple with how to translate our childhood experiences into our new families. What does it mean for us and our children that we come from the people who have often hurt us most?In my baby’s first months of life, I experienced intrusive thoughts that a switch would flip inside me and I would hurt my child, too. The vivid images filled me with horror and anxiety. I dreaded my husband’s return to work. In the first few weeks alone with our baby, I paused at the end of each day to give myself credit for keeping her safe and healthy.My therapist, whom I began seeing when I was pregnant, told me that the intrusive thoughts were a manifestation of my fear of becoming abusive, too.“You have them because you’re scared of hurting your baby, not because you want to,” she said.As the slow early days of motherhood passed, I realized she was right: Nothing in me wanted to hurt my child.Before I loved as a parent, the abuse I experienced growing up felt inevitable. I didn’t think of violence as a choice because I didn’t know what it was like to have total power over a child’s life.But when I held my newborn, her unassuming fragility broke my heart. What I had previously seen as an unavoidable part of my history suddenly looked like a series of incomprehensible parental decisions.It had never been my fate to be abused and abuse my child in turn. Abuse is rooted in a desire to control others and often a belief that one’s own desires should take precedence over other people’s needs, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Addiction and other untreated mental health conditions can loosen a person’s inhibitions and intensify abuse, but the core causes are authoritarianism and self-centeredness.I could choose differently.When my daughter was about a week old, I cut her fingernails for the first time. They had been jagged from birth but short, so I had waited because, like many first-time parents, I was afraid of accidentally cutting her tiny fingers.But the first time she swiped at her face with her talons, I pulled out the baby nail clippers, held my breath, and trimmed her soft nails as my younger sister held her. On the fourth finger, I snipped a bit of skin. My baby cried in pain and my husband grabbed a box of tissues.I tried to stop the bleeding, then my husband stepped in to help, and then my sister, who is a labor and delivery nurse. But because newborns’ blood is slow to clot, her finger bled for half an hour.I sat on the couch in a stunned, guilty silence. It was the first time I had clearly made a mistake for which my child was suffering. My sister — the same one whose finger I had scratched as a child, triggering abuse — pressed a tissue to my baby’s cut.AdvertisementSupported byBy Amy QinBEIJING — A man wielding a knife killed two students and injured two others at an elementary school in central China on Wednesday, according to the local authorities.The attack occurred early Wednesday morning at Baijiaping Township Wanquan Elementary School in Ningyuan County, Hunan Province. A brief statement issued by Ningyuan County on its official WeChat social media account said that the two injured students had been taken to a hospital. Reached by telephone, an official surnamed Feng at the public security bureau of Ningyuan County said the injured students were in stable condition but declined to offer more details.The statement said that the suspect, a 31-year-old man surnamed Zheng, had been taken into police custody. Officials offered no details on the motivation behind the attack. The incident is still under investigation.Videos circulating online showed a large crowd of anxious adults carrying umbrellas gathered outside the school gates.Gun violence is rare in China, where ownership of firearms is strictly regulated. But Wednesday’s violence was the latest in a string of knife attacks on Chinese schools in recent years, adding to persistent concerns among parents about school safety.In the last year, knife attacks have occurred at schools in Shaanxi Province, in Shanghai and in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. In January, a man attacked and injured 20 children with a hammer at an elementary school in Beijing.This week, the police in Henan Province said they had detained a kindergarten teacher on suspicion of poisoning 23 children.The frequency of school attacks has shown few signs of abating despite the fact that perpetrators of such crimes in China are often dealt severe punishment, including the death penalty.Experts have said the spate of school attacks can be attributed in part to a lack of high-quality mental health care in China and growing frustrations about social inequality and injustice. Some have pointed to a series of deadly stabbings of children in 2010 as the inspiration for later copycat attacks.Some users on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter, reacted to the news of the attack in Hunan on Wednesday by calling for the death penalty for the attacker. Others expressed disappointment that after so many years, the problem of school attacks had not yet been resolved.“When I was in elementary school, there were many attacks like this,” one user said. “Schools organized drills and hired many security guards with anti-riot gear to guard the gates.”“It’s hard to believe that now I’m about to graduate from college and humans are still doing the same thing, even though the era has changed,” the user added.AdvertisementSupported byMETROPOLITANA picture caption with an article on Page 1 about the mental health initiative ThriveNYC misidentifies the location of a community class.

And in the end, experts say, the result is far from certain.The process is mostly up to the courts, but politicians will have a hand in it, too, and were already drawing battle lines over Mr. Assange. Complicating matters, prosecutors in Sweden could reopen a rape investigation involving Mr. Assange and request extradition to that country, forcing the British government to decide which case would take precedence.“It’s not simple, and the defense will argue everything they can,” said Rebecca Niblock, a partner at the British law firm Kingsley Napley who specializes in extradition law. “I think it is going to be a long one. I’d say minimum a year and a half, but if things get complicated, it could be much longer.”Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, wrote on Thursday on Twitter, “The extradition of Julian Assange to the U.S. for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan should be opposed by the British government.”The Conservative Party government has avoided taking a position, while signaling that it takes a much less favorable view of Mr. Assange — and sees in him a potent political issue.Sajid Javid, who as home secretary has a role in the process, said in Parliament on Thursday that he “won’t be drawn into the request for extradition” or discuss “the details of the accusations against Mr. Assange, either in the U.K.’s criminal justice system, or in the U.S.”Diane Abbott, Mr. Javid’s Labour counterpart, said, “Julian Assange is not being pursued to protect U.S. national security; he’s being pursued because he has exposed wrongdoing by U.S. administrations and their military forces.”The partisan divide raises the prospect that a change of government could change Mr. Assange’s fortunes, because his case could take years to end. Britain’s next scheduled general election would be in 2022, and there is widespread speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May might call early elections.For years, Mr. Assange has been simultaneously hailed as a hero for transparency, and cursed as a reckless anarchist and publicity-seeker. In 2016, WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic Party emails, damaging the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in that election, reported in court documents that Russian intelligence was the source of those emails, which Mr. Assange has denied.But Mr. Assange has been in the sights of American officials since 2010, when WikiLeaks published an immense trove of classified material, primarily about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, taken from military computer systems by Chelsea Manning, an analyst in Army intelligence. Ms. Manning was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 35 years in prison, and spent nearly seven years in prison before her punishment was commuted by President Barack Obama.WikiLeaks and its defenders argue that it was following a standard practice of news organizations, publishing information of public interest, even if the person who supplied the information obtained it illegally.The case is about the “publishing of documents, of videos of killing of innocent civilians, exposure of war crimes,” Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks editor, told a news conference on Thursday. “This is journalism.”But the indictment unsealed on Thursday alleges that Mr. Assange, a native of Australia, went further, conspiring with Ms. Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, to help her hack into the military network.Mr. Assange’s defenders, including a number of human rights activists, contend that the case against him is not about hacking, but about releasing information that embarrassed the United States.For extradition to proceed under British law, the United States must submit a full extradition request, and Britain’s home secretary must certify that it is legally valid and send it to the courts — all by mid-June, Mr. Javid said. Then the matter goes to an extradition hearing before a judge, whose rulings can be appealed all the way up to Britain’s Supreme Court.Two recent, high-profile cases could point the way for Mr. Assange’s defense. The American authorities sought the extradition of Lauri Love, a British man charged with hacking into dozens of United States government computer systems, and Stuart Scott, a banker charged with currency manipulation.In each case, a judge ruled against the defendant but the decision was overturned on appeal, partly on the grounds that the alleged illegal acts occurred in Britain, which meant any prosecution should take place in Britain.If the courts uphold extradition, it is up to the home secretary to actually order it. The law gives the home secretary some leeway to defy the ruling and refuse extradition, though not much.In another hacking case, the United States sought to prosecute Gary McKinnon, who was accused of gaining unauthorized access to dozens of government computers, in search, he said, of information about U.F.O.s.After a decade of legal battles, the British courts ultimately decided against him. But in 2012, the home secretary at the time, Mrs. May, refused to order extradition based on Mr. McKinnon’s mental health and the risk that he might commit suicide.Since then, court decisions have narrowed the range of discretion available, but the courts could take Mr. Assange’s condition into account, said Ms. Niblock, the extradition lawyer.“His physical and mental health have undoubtedly deteriorated over the past seven years,” she added.In 2010, Swedish prosecutors ordered the arrest of Mr. Assange, who was living in Britain, to be questioned about allegations of sexual misconduct and rape in Sweden. While free on bail, he fought extradition to Sweden — which he said would turn him over to the United States — until he exhausted his appeals in 2012. Mr. Assange has denied the allegations against him.Rather than submit to extradition, he took refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and the country granted him asylum. British prosecutors charged him with violating the terms of his bail.In 2017, Swedish prosecutors set aside the rape case and the extradition request, saying that the effort was moot with Mr. Assange in the embassy.On Thursday, Ecuador’s government withdrew his asylum status after almost seven years, and allowed British police to enter the embassy and arrest him. He was swiftly convicted on the bail charge, for which he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison.The next day, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said it was looking into the possibility of reopening its case against him.AdvertisementSupported byBy Richard Pérez-PeñaLONDON — Dutch prosecutors said on Thursday that they planned to bring terrorism charges against a man suspected of killing three people on a tram in the city of Utrecht, in addition to multiple counts of murder or manslaughter.In a statement, the public prosecutor’s office in the Netherlands suggested that the mental health of the suspect, Gokmen Tanis, was also under investigation, as well as his motives.“It’s being investigated if the suspect acted out of solely terrorist motive or that his actions came from personal problems in combination with radicalized ideology,” prosecutors said. “The Dutch Institute for Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology will be asked to conduct an investigation of the suspect’s personality.”Mr. Tanis, 37, is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday in his first court appearance in connection with the shootings in Utrecht.The office said that Mr. Tanis was suspected of murder or manslaughter with terrorist intent, attempted murder or manslaughter, and threats with terrorist intent. The attack on Monday on a busy tram left three people dead and five more injured.People in Utrecht who know Mr. Tanis, who was born in Turkey, say he was erratic and sometimes violent, and recently espoused a strict form of Islam. He had been arrested multiple times and was facing a rape charge.The tram shooting occurred three days after 50 people were killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, but there was no evidence that the events in Utrecht were linked to that massacre.Dutch prosecutors did not say what evidence pointed toward terrorism, but the police have said that a note found in a stolen car that the gunman used to flee the scene supported that suspicion. Officials have not said what was in the note.So far, prosecutor’s office said, the evidence suggested “that the suspect did not have help from other persons during the shooting.”An 40-year-old man whom the police have not identified publicly has been detained since Tuesday. Prosecutors said that he did not take part in the attack, but that they were still investigating whether “he possibly had a supporting role.” Others detained this week were not involved and had been released, the police have said.Some who know Mr. Tanis and his family in the Netherlands and in Turkey have suggested that the shooting stemmed from a domestic dispute. But prosecutors and the police have said that there was no indication that he knew any of the victims.Claire Moses contributed reporting.AdvertisementSupported byThe president lied about abortion in the State of the Union.By Michelle GoldbergOpinion ColumnistThe State of the Union address on Tuesday night was, as expected, an interminable farrago of boasting, nativism, saccharine clichés and outright lies. Among the biggest of those lies were Donald Trump’s claims about third-trimester abortion. “Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth,” he said of the state’s recent Reproductive Health Act. He added, “And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.”That governor, Ralph Northam, is not an easy man to defend at the moment, given the vile racist photographs recently discovered in his medical school yearbook, and the way he’s clinging to office despite near-universal Democratic calls for his resignation. Nevertheless, Northam’s words about a proposed change to Virginia abortion law — one with no chance of passing — have been grossly and cynically mischaracterized by the right in the service of ginning up a moral panic.Northam, speaking on the radio, was responding to a ridiculous hypothetical, floated by the Republican majority leader in the Virginia House of Delegates, about a woman in labor getting a doctor’s certification to obtain an abortion for mental health reasons.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The governor made the mistake of taking this scenario seriously. He surely knew, even if the Republican lawmaker did not, that in Virginia, when a woman terminates a pregnancy because the fetus has severe abnormalities and can’t survive outside the womb, it falls under the rubric of protecting her mental health. (The law has no separate exception for fetal viability.) He, therefore, described what would actually happen if, during labor, grave fetal health problems were discovered. The infant, he said, would be delivered and kept comfortable while the family decided how to proceed. He was not advocating killing newborns, which is illegal, and would remain so under the proposed change to Virginia’s law.It also remains illegal under New York’s new law, which, among other things, allows for terminations after 24 weeks when a fetus isn’t viable or when a woman’s health is at risk. Previously, such abortions were allowed only to save a woman’s life. The New York Civil Liberties Union, in documenting the injustices of the old law, described the ordeal of a woman named Sophia who unexpectedly became pregnant while battling five types of cancer. “Sophia learned that the fetus had multiple severe anomalies as a result of her cancer treatment, and was unlikely to survive after birth,” the group wrote. “However, because Sophia’s pregnancy was beyond New York’s 24-week legal limit, providers would not take the apparent legal risk associated with performing an abortion.” She ended up traveling 2,000 miles to have the procedure in another state.There’s probably no way to get anti-abortion conservatives to let go of the idea that the pro-choice agenda involves the wanton killing of full-term babies. Some genuinely believe that liberals and feminists practice something akin to human sacrifice. (“It is clear Moloch has worshipers today and to this false god the children of America are being offered up on the altars of autonomy and choice,” said a Christian Post op-ed about New York’s new abortion law.) Others, like Trump, are indifferent to the complicated reality and simply delighted by the opportunity to adopt a pose of moral sanctimony. Trump clearly views late abortion as an expedient wedge issue; in his State of the Union address, he called on Congress to pass a law banning abortion “of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.” While such a law has no chance in the current Congress, the proposal is a useful reminder that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion law won’t simply be left to the states, because the anti-abortion movement is eager to pass national restrictions.After the State of the Union, abortion opponents, among the president’s most loyal backers, were ebullient. “Once again President Trump has proved he is our nation’s most #ProLife president ever,” tweeted the Susan B. Anthony List.Their satisfaction may, however, be misplaced. Late abortion is a complex issue, and a great many Americans find it deeply disturbing. Trump, however, is so hated that he tends to turn many people against whatever it is he argues for. (It’s part of the reason support for both immigration and Obamacare has risen during his tenure.)  There may be no better way to persuade the ambivalent that late abortions are sometimes a tragic necessity than for Trump to floridly denounce them.I’m not looking forward to yet another  reprise of the abortion wars. But if someone’s going to lead an old-fashioned family values charge, it might as well be the living embodiment of louche male chauvinism, a man who refuses to say whether he has ever paid for an abortion himself. Trump is incapable of telling the truth, but he’s a pretty honest symbol of the patriarchal ideals of the movement that’s made him its champion.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Similar legislation has been introduced in past years. Despite what you might have heard, at no point did Tran try to legalize infanticide.When Tran appeared before a statehouse subcommittee, the Republican majority leader, Todd Gilbert, presented her with an outré hypothetical. Could a woman about to go into labor request an abortion if her doctor certified that she needed one for mental health reasons? Tran said that the decision would be between a woman and her doctor, but, evidently taken aback by the question, eventually allowed that it would be permitted under her bill.Tran handled the moment poorly. She might have pointed out that legislation is not generally written with an eye to prohibiting ridiculous and unprecedented scenarios. It is inconceivable that a doctor would certify a need for an abortion while a woman is in labor; some doctors won’t even let a woman turn down a C-section if they think a baby’s health is at risk. But Tran’s impolitic answer to a ludicrous question gave abortion opponents grist for an explosion of self-righteous outrage.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]Things only escalated on Wednesday, when Gov. Ralph Northam was asked about the uproar during an appearance on a radio show. Northam, a pediatric neurologist by training, spoke about what actually happens when a woman goes into labor with a fetus that has severe deformities and may not be viable. The infant, he said, would be delivered and kept comfortable, and the family would decide about resuscitation.Northam appeared to be pointing out the absurdity of Gilbert’s hypothetical, since even in grave circumstances, no one gets an abortion on the delivery table. But as a clip of the interview went viral, conservatives, including the Republican senator Marco Rubio, began accusing Northam of supporting the murder of newborns. It was the right-wing version of an online outrage mob, warping the governor's innocuous comments into a callous declaration of evil.Some seemed almost gleeful at the prospect of seizing the moral high ground denied them over two years of rationalizing a depraved administration. “You people keep saying to look at Trump getting elected to see how Hitler could be possible,” tweeted the conservative pundit Erick Erickson. “I’m thinking look at the sudden embrace of infanticide to see how Nazism could be possible.”In some ways the issue of Tran’s bill is moot, since it was never going to pass in Virginia’s Republican-controlled legislature, and certainly has no chance now. But the debate over late-term abortion has been rekindled. For Donald Trump, who tweeted about the procedure on Thursday, it’s a culture war issue he can exploit. Others on the right are genuinely sickened by what they imagine liberals want to allow, even if they also appear to be enjoying the chance to once again scold the left for its purported immorality.“Under the bill’s actual text, virtually any claim of impairment would suffice to meet the act’s requirements,” wrote National Review’s David French. “Anxiety? Depression? The conventional physical challenges of postpartum recovery? Any of those things could justify taking the life of a fully formed, completely viable, living infant.”French appears to be worried that women will seek, and doctors will perform, late-term abortions for trivial reasons. But there’s contempt for women embedded in the idea that, absent legal prohibition, someone on the verge of giving birth might instead terminate her pregnancy to avoid the brutalities of labor. “No matter what the law were, in real life, these things don’t happen,” said Frances Kissling, president of the Center for Health, Ethics and Social Policy and the former head of Catholics for a Free Choice. “I am not saying that there would not be one woman out of 20 million who decided at the 33rd week of pregnancy that she needed an abortion, and I would suggest that she probably does have mental health problems. However, this woman is not going to find anyone who will do this.”Kissling is well known in the pro-choice movement for thinking deeply about the ethical gray areas surrounding abortion. As she points out, there are only about a dozen doctors in the country who perform third-trimester abortions at all, and she’s spoken to several of them, asking specific questions about patients they’ve turned down. “What I have learned is that all of them have limits and have declined to do abortions in certain circumstances for certain reasons,” she said. (The murderous abortionist Kermit Gosnell, serving a life sentence in prison, is an exception, but he was operating outside the law.)A person who is ambivalent about abortion might wonder why, if the situations put forward by Gilbert and French are so unthinkable, pro-choice people would object to laws making them illegal. But the law is a blunt instrument for making judgments about extreme and unusual contingencies. Having extra doctors sign off on each late abortion safeguards against (mythical) cavalier terminations, but it means that women in anguished, urgent situations need to jump through extra hoops. Abortion opponents treat mental health exemptions as easily exploited loopholes, but one instance in which they’re invoked is when a woman learns that her fetus has little chance of surviving outside the womb, and can’t face the prospect of going through labor only to watch her baby die.This is not to say that there aren’t third-trimester abortions that many people would find morally objectionable. Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are quite rare — such procedures make up just over 1 percent of all terminations, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures — and there’s little solid data about the reasons women have them. Thus much of the debate relies on anecdote. There are many tragic stories of women forced to abort desperately wanted pregnancies because of harrowing medical emergencies, but also more complicated cases of, for example, young girls who hid their pregnancies for months, or whose abortions were delayed by restrictive laws in their states. “Our talking point is, most of these procedures are on women who discover abnormalities late in the pregnancy,” Kissling said. “We don’t know if that is true.”Conservatives might see vindication in this admission, but it leaves us with the question of whether we want to use the law to make fine-grained moral distinctions, particularly in the absence of good information about the life-or-death choices we’re regulating. “This is so complicated, that we can set this guideline, but then we have to leave it to medicine, to the doctor and the woman, to figure this out,” argued Kissling. There’s certainly no reason to trust the people who elected Trump to make profound ethical decisions for us.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., raising populist themes and praising the way immigration has enriched El Paso and the nation.Speaking at a downtown rally near the border with Mexico, Mr. O’Rourke said that his hometown, El Paso, its embrace of immigration and its rich ties with Mexico represented the best of the American experience, adding that the challenges facing the country presented “a moment of truth.”Quoting Dr. King, he said El Paso and its Mexican neighbor of Ciudad Juárez were “caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”He added, “This is a campaign for America, for everyone in America.”[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]His words and the setting on the street that connects El Paso with Ciudad Juárez symbolized what his campaign said would be one of Mr. O’Rourke’s themes — a “unifying vision for bridging divides” to unite Americans from all walks of life.But the speech by Mr. O’Rourke, a former three-term member of Congress, comes at a time of extraordinary discord over immigration, with a surge of migrants trying to enter the United States and President Trump threatening to seal off the border next week.El Paso has been a flash point for much of that unrest, with hundreds of migrants now being held in a makeshift encampment under a bridge near where Mr. O’Rourke was speaking.The encampment, where immigration officials are detaining people behind razor wire with little hot food, was set up last week when El Paso’s main border processing center reached overflow capacity following the largest influx of migrants in years.Acknowledging the plight of the migrants, Mr. O’Rourke said, “Let us remember that every single one of us, including those who are just three or four blocks from here detained under the international bridge — behind chain-link fence and barbed wire — they are our fellow human beings and deserve to be treated like our fellow human beings.”Mr. O’Rourke, who also held rallies Saturday in Houston and outside the state’s capitol in Austin, stressed not only immigration but also health care, education, climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, voting rights and racial inequality. All are topics that have emerged as major issues in the effort by Democrats to unseat Mr. Trump in 2020.[Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]“This is our moment of truth and we cannot be found wanting,” he told the enthusiastic crowd. “The challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetimes. An economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many more. A health care system where millions are unable to see a doctor or be well enough to live to their full potential and the last, best hope of averting the catastrophe that will follow climate change, fading before our very inaction. We must overcome these challenges.”Mr. O’Rourke was introduced by his wife, Amy O’Rourke, an educator. The couple’s three children also attended.Mr. O’Rourke has been campaigning for two weeks, often in impromptu sessions in cafes or intimate town halls. But this was billed as his first major public event and opportunity to present the broad themes of his campaign.Speaking extemporaneously for 34 minutes, gesticulating as he walked around a stage set in the middle of the street, Mr. O’Rourke hit particularly hard on access to health care and prescription drug costs.“When one of the largest providers of mental health care services is a county jail system, and in a nation that is in the midst of a maternal mortality crisis — three times as deadly for women of color — let us ensure that universal health care means we can see a primary care provider, all of us can get mental health care, and that universal health care means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body,” he said.He also called for better pay for teachers — “let’s pay them what they’re worth” — and a “world-class public school system from pre-K to 12.”The crowd of several thousand supporters included Marta Lopez, 71, a retired state worker from El Paso, who had come wearing a black-and-white BETO T-shirt.“We’ve lived here all our lives, and I feel we don’t need a wall,” said Ms. Lopez, adding that she admires Mr. O’Rourke’s positions on immigration as well as his pledge not to accept PAC money.Several supporters of Mr. O’Rourke said they were intimidated by a gantlet of pro-Trump protesters blocking their way to the rally.“They were just very confrontational and yelling scary stuff at us,’’ said Thelma Ramos, 38, of El Paso, who came with her 13-year-old daughter.Mr. O’Rourke, 46, grew up in this Texas border city, the son of a local political figure and a furniture store operator. He had little name recognition until last year, when he became a national figure during his unsuccessful effort to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican.With a progressive sheen and grass-roots appeal, Mr. O’Rourke set fund-raising records in that Senate campaign. He continued that record-setting pace in the 24 hours after announcing his White House ambitions two weeks ago, raising more than $6.1 million online in one day. That outpaced the $5.9 million collected by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his first day.Some recent polls place Mr. O’Rourke third in popularity among Democrats expected to be in the race, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his intentions, and Mr. Sanders.And if his style is entirely different from Mr. Sanders, he hit many similar themes.“For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless,” he said. “They have used fears and division in the same way that our current president uses fear and division.”AdvertisementSupported byIn “Deep Medicine,” Dr. Eric Topol looks at the ways that A.I. could improve health care, and where it might stumble.By Anahad O’ConnorLast month, President Trump signed an executive order making the development and regulation of artificial intelligence a federal priority. But one area where artificial intelligence is already taking hold is health care. Doctors are already using A.I. to spot potentially lethal lesions on mammograms. Scientists are also developing A.I. systems that can diagnose common childhood conditions, predict whether a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease and monitor people with conditions like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, has long heralded this convergence of technology and medicine. Now, in a new book called “Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again,” Dr. Topol explores how A.I. is likely to transform almost everything that doctors do.Dr. Topol believes that A.I. can do more than enhance diagnoses and treatments. It can also save doctors from doing tasks like taking notes and reading scans, allowing them to spend more time connecting with their patients. Recently, we caught up with Dr. Topol to discuss his thoughts on where A.I. has the most potential to improve health care, where it might stumble, and how it could protect doctors from things like burnout and depression. Here are edited excerpts from our interview. Q. Can A.I. help to lower America’s soaring health care costs?A. Yes. The No. 1 line item of health care cost in America is human resources, which has recently grown — as of December 2017 towering over retail — to be the leading job source for our economy. By augmenting human performance, A.I. has the potential to markedly improve productivity, efficiency, work flow, accuracy and speed, both for doctors and for patients. giving more charge and control to consumers through algorithmic support of their data. Q. Can you talk about the area of medicine where A.I. shows the most promise?A. There are a few key areas. One is machine pattern recognition to promote the rapid and accurate reading of medical scans, slides, skin lesions, the pickup of small polyps during colonoscopy, and much more. Another is keyboard liberation, or using natural language processing of speech to synthesize notes and eliminate the ultimate source of distraction and dislike in medical encounters. A.I. can also predict key outcomes for both patients and clinicians to promote prevention. Q. Where is A.I. most likely to fail?A. There’s no shortage of deep liabilities for A.I. in health care. The liabilities include breaches of privacy and security, hacking, the lack of explainability of most A.I. algorithms, the potential to worsen inequities, the embedded bias and ethical quandaries.Q. In your book you talk a lot about the rapid growth of A.I. companies in the radiology space. Will A.I. make radiologists obsolete?A. Absolutely not. I wrote about a new role for radiologists, whereby they come out of the basement and have direct interactions with patients. We can’t, and will never, rely on only algorithms for interpretation of life and death matters. That requires human expert contextualization, something machines can’t do.Q. Can you share your thoughts on one or two of the most innovative or impressive A.I. companies you’ve come across?A. I don’t think there’s a standout just yet. For start-ups, I admire the way AliveCor, with their Mayo Clinic collaboration, was able to develop deep learning algorithms to determine a person’s blood potassium levels via a smartwatch ECG signal. For tech titans, Google AI and its DeepMind division has done some impressive work that includes accurately triaging urgent eye conditions, predicting outcomes in the hospital setting, and an important prospective study of pathology slides in cancer.Q. You’ve long been a big fan of personalized nutrition. Will we ever get to a point where A.I. can determine the best diet for every individual?A. There are emerging data to support this possibility, such as avoiding glucose spikes after eating, which are highly individualized, much more common than anticipated, and related to the specific foods we take in and our gut microbiomes. It’s still early but definitely getting traction from ongoing work.Q. In the future will A.I.-assisted robots replace surgeons?A. No way. A.I. can help the precision of delicate microsurgery, as we have already seen with the retina. There will be better robots for surgery than we have now. But that won’t obviate the need for human surgeons. It will just augment their performance. Would you want your surgery to be done by a robot? Q. Studies show that A.I. can detect depression by scanning a person’s Instagram photos. Could A.I. be a game changer for the mental health field?A. Yes, but not via your Instagram posts! For the first time we’ve got real-time, objective metrics for state of mind and mood like tone of speech, breathing pattern, smartphone keystrokes and communication, and physical activity. And we’ve learned people would rather share their innermost secrets with an avatar compared with a human being. So, the landscape is ripe for A.I. to help alleviate the profound shortage of health professionals compared with the enormous burden of depression and other mental health conditions. Q. What are you most excited about with A.I. in health care? Is there anything that worries you?AdvertisementSupported byPhys EdJogging for 15 minutes a day, or walking or gardening for somewhat longer, could help protect people against developing depression.By Gretchen ReynoldsJogging for 15 minutes a day, or walking or gardening for somewhat longer, could help protect people against developing depression, according to an innovative new study published last month in JAMA Psychiatry. The study involved hundreds of thousands of people and used a type of statistical analysis to establish, for the first time, that physical activity may help prevent depression, a finding with considerable relevance for any of us interested in maintaining or bolstering our mental health.Plenty of past studies have examined the connections between exercise, moods and psychological well-being, of course. And most have concluded that physically active people tend to be happier and less prone to anxiety and severe depression than people who seldom move much.But those past studies showed only that exercise and depression are linked, not that exercise actually causes a drop in depression risk. Most were longitudinal or cross-sectional, looking at people’s exercise habits over a certain period or at a single point of time and then determining whether there might be statistical relationships between the two. In other words, active people might be less likely to become depressed than inactive people. But it’s also possible that people who aren’t prone to depression may be more likely to exercise. Those types of studies may be tantalizing, but they can’t prove anything about cause and effect.To show causation, scientists rely on randomized experiments, during which they assign people to, for instance, exercise or not and then monitor the outcomes. Researchers have been using randomized trials to look at whether exercise can treat depression after people already have developed the condition, and the results have been encouraging.But it would be almost impossible to mount a randomized trial looking at whether exercise prevents depression, since you would need to recruit a large number of people, convince some to exercise, others not, follow them for years and hope that enough develop depression to make any statistical analysis meaningful. The logistics involved would be daunting, if not impossible, and the costs prohibitive.Enter Mendelian randomization. This is a relatively new type of “data science hack” being used to analyze health risks, says Karmel Choi, a postdoctoral research fellow in psychiatric genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who led the new study.With Mendelian randomization, scientists zero in on small snippets of genes that vary from person to person. These variants are passed out before birth and do not change afterward; they are not altered by upbringing. Thanks to large-scale genetics studies, scientists have associated many of these snippets with specific health behaviors and risks. People with certain gene variants are, for example, more likely to overeat or be physically active than people without that variant.More recently, scientists realized that these differences in people’s DNA offered, in effect, ready-made randomized trials designed by nature, since the variants occurred in mathematically random fashion.Because of that inherent randomization, scientists could crosscheck the numbers of people with or without a snippet related to a health risk or behavior, such as, say, a strong likelihood to exercise, against another health outcome, such as severe depression. And if a large percentage of people with the variant did not develop the condition, scientists felt they could conclude that the behavior related to that variant caused the change in risk for the other condition.And that result is what Dr. Choi and her colleagues found when they applied Mendelian randomization to exercise and depression. To reach that conclusion, they turned first to the UK Biobank, an enormous database of genetic and health information for almost 400,000 men and women. There they identified people who carried at least one of several gene variants believed to increase the likelihood someone will be active. Most of those people were active, and few of them had experienced depression.People without the snippets, meanwhile, tended to move less, and they also showed greater risks for depression.Delving deeper, the scientists found that, statistically, the ideal amount of exercise to prevent depression started at about 15 minutes a day of running or other strenuous exercise. Less-taxing activities like fast walking, housework and so on also afforded protection against depression, but it took about an hour a day to have an effect.Finally, to be sure that physical activity was affecting the risk for depression, and not the other way around, the scientists repeated the Mendelian style of analysis on a separate large genetic database. This time they looked for gene variants related to depression and whether people who carried those variants and a propensity for depression tended to be physically inactive. It turned out, they did not.So, the researchers concluded, physical activity in this analysis lowered the risk for depression, but depression did not affect whether people exercised.AdvertisementSupported byDr. Natasha Bhuyan and Dr. Patrick W.

He then doused both cars in accelerant fluid and lit his own car on fire. As police officers approached, the man, who was not wearing pants or underwear, lunged at them with a 12-inch kitchen knife.Two police officers then fired eight gunshots, striking the man in his torso and leg. The man was transported to NewYork-Presbyterian/Queens hospital, where he remained in stable condition on Sunday night. The two officers were also transported to a hospital to be evaluated.The police did not identify the man but said he was not previously known to the officers in the precinct.Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of patrol, said at a news conference that it was likely the man had “some mental issues.”In recent years, the department has tried to increase training for officers about how to handle situations involving emotionally disturbed people. But less than 12,000 of the city’s nearly 37,000 officers have gone through the training. Emergency calls for those situations have nearly doubled over the last decade, to about 179,000 last year, according to the police.Officers are often unaware if a person is mentally ill when they respond to a call.On March 5, police oficers responding to a 911 call in Harlem shot a man, Michael Cordero, after he claimed he was armed and then lunged at them with an item in his hand that turned out to be a wallet. Mr. Cordero had several previous arrests, and his family said he was being treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Last year, the attorney general’s office began investigating the police killing of Saheed Vassell, who in April was fatally shot by officers who mistook the pipe he was holding for a gun. Mr. Vassell had bipolar disorder, and his family said that the police at his local precinct knew of his condition.In both of those cases, the police have said, the responding officers were unaware of the men’s mental histories.The city adopted crisis intervention training in 2015 but has been slow to roll it out. Police officials have said they need more money to accelerate training, and Mayor Bill de Blasio allocated $5.3 million in his recent budget proposal to train more officers.On Tuesday the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray, will testify in front of City Council about ThriveNYC, a nearly $1 billion plan to address mental health in New York City. Despite Mr. de Blasio touting the program, which Ms. McCray oversees, as “revolutionary,”  it has faced questions about its effectiveness.AdvertisementSupported byBy Emily S. RuebThe mother of Raniya Wright, the fifth grader who died after a fight at her South Carolina school, said on Monday that another student taunted her daughter into a physical altercation on the day of the fight and that she had previously told the school her daughter was being bullied.The mother, Ashley Wright, told “Good Morning America” that Forest Hills Elementary School in Walterboro, S.C., about an hour west of Charleston, did not do enough to protect her daughter.“I notified the school, and I also spoke with her teacher at the time about this same person,” Ms. Wright said about the student, a girl, who she said had been “picking on” her daughter. “I’m thinking, ‘They got it handled,’” she said. “And they failed me.”Ms. Wright said in the interview that she talked to students about what happened on March 25, the day Raniya, 10, was taken to the hospital unconscious but breathing. Ms. Wright said she was told the girl approached Raniya from behind and hit her on the head.“She pushed her and she rammed her head or something into the bookshelf,” Ms. Wright said, adding that a substitute teacher in the classroom may have been distracted. “The other kids said she was on her phone,” she said.The student involved in the episode has been suspended until the investigation is completed, according to the Colleton County School District’s website.The superintendent of the district, Franklin Foster, denied Ms. Wright’s accusations on Monday.“We adamantly disagree with any claim that we did not do enough to protect Raniya,” Mr. Foster said in a statement. “We work hard every day to protect all of our students. In time, the facts regarding this tragic incident will be revealed.”Mr. Foster declined to provide any further details, citing a pending law enforcement investigation and student privacy laws.Shalane Lowes, spokeswoman for the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office, declined to comment on Monday, citing the open investigation.An autopsy was performed at the Medical University of South Carolina, but the authorities said it would be a few weeks before the results would be made public.Raniya’s death, and how the school handled it, has angered and aggrieved the community and spurred parents and state lawmakers to grapple with violence in the classroom.Legislators in South Carolina have proposed measures that would address how schools report and investigate bullying, and the state plans to increase the number of mental health professionals in schools.Raniya’s family said it had received little information from officials about how she died.“I had to sleep by my baby the night before she passed and that was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life,” Ms. Wright said.Last week, Raniya’s white coffin arrived in a white carriage led by two white horses at Saints Center Ministries in Walterboro, where hundreds of mourners attended her funeral.Raniya’s fourth-grade teacher, Debi Price, told The State newspaper that she remembered how Raniya “took care of people.”“She brought laughter into my classroom every day,” Ms. Price said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Gold and Tyler PagerIn the more than six years since his daughter Avielle was killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Jeremy Richman had devoted his life to preventing families from experiencing the kind of tragic loss he did.With his wife, Jennifer Hensel, he created the Avielle Foundation to support research into brain abnormalities that could be linked to violent behavior. In this endeavor, he stressed mental health education and compassion.“Compassion is the ability to feel somebody else’s suffering, to empathize,” Mr. Richman, a neuroscientist, said in a video for the foundation. “But most importantly, it’s the hope that you can do something to alleviate that suffering.”On Monday, Mr. Richman, 49, was found dead in an apparent suicide in the Newtown, Conn., building where the Avielle Foundation had an office, the local police said. His death was all the more shocking given the scope of his work, community members said.“Our hearts are shattered, and our heads are struggling to comprehend,” the foundation said in a statement.“Tragically, his death speaks to how insidious and formidable a challenge brain health can be and how critical it is for all of us to seek help for ourselves, our loved ones and anyone who we suspect may be in need,” it continued.The police were called to Edmond Town Hall, a movie theater and event space that also rented offices and meeting rooms, at about 7 a.m. on Monday by contractors who were working there, said Lt. Aaron Bahamonde of the Newtown Police Department.Upon arriving, the police also found a note left by Mr. Richman. Lieutenant Bahamonde did not disclose what it said.The police and the state’s medical examiner’s office were investigating the death, he said.Mr. Richman’s death came more than six years after a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing Avielle, 6, and 25 other people, before turning the gun on himself. The massacre, on Dec. 14, 2012, thrust Newtown into the caustic national debates on gun control and mental health.Some of the police officers who reported to Edmond Town Hall on Monday had responded to the school shooting, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.[Newtown shows how mourning evolves and endures for years after mass violence.]“It’s something that you never expect to see happen, but in the back of your mind you know that many of us are still suffering,” said Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse Lewis, 6, also died in the shooting. “He was a good friend, and it was an honor and a privilege to have known him. He did a wonderful job with the foundation, building his daughter’s legacy.Mr. Heslin added: “I’m sure it will rip open a lot in Newtown again. The town hall will be another tragic place here, like the school.”After the Sandy Hook shooting, Mr. Richman expressed grief over his daughter’s death through verse, friends said. On Fridays, the day of the week that the shooting occurred, Mr. Richman posted haiku on his Facebook page. Some of the poems were haunting, including one on Dec. 5, 2015, titled “Anniversary,” which he posted beside a photograph of himself and his wife on a visit to Avielle’s grave:What is your numberWhen will your heart be broken?Mine is 12/14But Mr. Richman also channeled his grief into action, leaving his job at a pharmaceutical company to focus full time on the foundation. He began hosting discussions and speaking at academic events about brain health and violence.Last week, he was the keynote speaker at a summit at Florida Atlantic University, where he talked about research that was geared toward helping people identify the symptoms of those in crisis and support those at risk of harming themselves or others.As the Avielle Foundation pursued grants to encourage such research, Mr. Richman often spoke with lawmakers to discuss the nonprofit’s findings and push for action.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat who has been a leading advocate against gun violence, said he was devastated and heartbroken by Mr. Richman’s death. The two became close friends, Mr. Murphy said, and Mr. Richman regularly briefed staff members on Capitol Hill about his foundation’s work.They last met in the senator’s Washington office two weeks ago.“He seemed as excited about his work as I’d ever seen him, which makes the morning’s news so unthinkable,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Richman earned a doctorate in pharmacology and toxicology from the University of Arizona in 1998. He also received a bachelor’s degree in molecular and cellular biology from the university in 1992.Before starting the Avielle Foundation, he worked in drug discovery for pharmaceutical companies in California and Connecticut.He also had an appointment as a faculty lecturer in psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. In 2016, Yale’s Department of Psychiatry honored Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel with its Research Advocacy Award.Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel were among the Sandy Hook families who had filed lawsuits against the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the host of Infowars, a radio show and website. Mr. Jones has said the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.The lawsuit involving Mr. Richman and Ms. Hensel says that Mr. Jones embarked on a campaign of “abusive and outrageous false statements in which Jones and the other defendants have developed, amplified and perpetuated claims that the Sandy Hook massacre was staged and that the 26 families who lost loved ones that day are paid actors who faked their relatives’ deaths.”After the shooting, some conspiracy theorists targeted Mr. Richman and his family, falsely claiming that Avielle’s death was faked as part of a moneymaking scheme.In a statement, Mr. Jones’s lawyer, Norm Pattis, said Mr. Jones “sends his condolences to Mr. Richman’s family and wishes only for peace.”The news of Mr. Richman’s death came shortly after two students who survived last year’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., died in apparent suicides. Their deaths sparked a discussion about suicide prevention efforts and the need for long-term resources for young people struggling to cope with trauma and loss.In Newtown, school district administrators reached out to counselors, psychologists and social workers early Monday, alerting them to Mr. Richman’s death so they could prepare to help students and staff members grieve, according to the Newtown school superintendent, Lorrie Rodrigue.Through his foundation, Mr. Richman had worked closely with the school district’s central office in the past. Some Newtown High School students had also interned with the Avielle Foundation.“I knew this was going to be very devastating to the entire community and school community,” Ms. Rodrigue said.In addition to his wife, Mr. Richman is survived by two children, Imogen and Owen.[If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

Backstage, she told reporters that the message of greater gender equity was immediately clear to her when the nominations were announced in December.[Read about Michelle Obama joining Alicia Keys onstage.]The award for album of the year went to Kacey Musgraves for “Golden Hour,” a collection that stretched the boundaries of country and drew deep respect from critics. She also took home three other prizes in the country field.“Women have a really necessary perspective — to life, to music,” Musgraves told reporters backstage. “It’s really nice to see that getting a chance to be included.”Many of the awards won by men highlighted the Grammys’ fraught history with hip-hop. Both the record and song of the year prizes — the latter awarded for songwriting — were won by Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” a thumping, confrontational song about racial injustice.It was the first hip-hop song to win either award. But Donald Glover, the actor and musician who performs as Childish Gambino, was absent. He, along with Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the two most powerful and influential young rappers in music, were offered performance spots on the show but turned them down, reflecting the alienation from the Grammys that has taken hold among much of the upper ranks of hip-hop.Drake was there to accept the award for best rap song, for “God’s Plan” from his blockbuster album “Scorpion.” Before his speech was cut off, he alluded to the gulf between the Grammy establishment and hip-hop culture.“This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or a brother from Houston,” he said.“But the point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, you don’t need this right here,” he added, holding up the Grammy.Brandi Carlile, an earnest female singer-songwriter in an Americana style, was the dark horse of the show, getting six nominations — more than any other woman — including in the top categories of album, record and song of the year.She gave a powerful, arena-filling performance of her song “The Joke,” and ended up winning three awards, though none in the top categories. She took best American roots performance and song for “The Joke,” and Americana album for “By the Way, I Forgive You.” They were the first Grammys of her career.Lamar and Drake, the two most-nominated artists — with eight and seven nods, respectively — each won only one. Lamar’s “King’s Dead,” from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, tied for best rap performance with Anderson .Paak’s “Bubblin.”Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won a total of four awards, including rap/sung performance and best music video.The ceremony began with the 21-year-old singer Camila Cabello performing her song “Havana” on a neon-colored city street scene, joined by a white-suited Ricky Martin, J Balvin and Young Thug.But the first moment of major star power came a few minutes later, when Alicia Keys, the host, introduced “my sisters”: Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez. Each spoke about the inspiring power of music throughout their lives.Obama, drawing a thunderous welcome from the crowd at the Staples Center, was nearly drowned out as she delivered her lines.“From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side,” she said, “to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story.”One superstar woman after another performed solo routines, as if they were fleshing out different views of diva-hood.Janelle Monáe performed “Make Me Feel” with bits of inspiration from Prince and Michael Jackson, but focused on female sexuality, surrounded by female dancers in tight rubber outfits.[Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed during the show.]With Cooper absent, Lady Gaga took both parts of “Shallow” herself. Dressed in a black sequined suit and high platform heels, she thrashed on the stage like a 1970s arena rocker, as pyrotechnics announced the song’s climax.Jennifer Lopez led a Motown tribute performed as a Vegas-style revue. She was joined by Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, with a medley of about 10 songs jammed into six minutes and featuring gymnastic, bottom-shaking, somersaulting dancing.Cardi B won the first Grammy of her career, best rap album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Holding the hand of her husband, the rapper Offset, she joked about struggling for composure — “Maybe I should start smoking weed!” — before talking about the long nights she worked to finish her album and shoot videos while pregnant. She is the first female solo artist to win in the category.Earlier, she performed “Money” dressed in purple and black like a supervillain, while dancers around her moved and spread their legs in synchronous motion like a bawdy Busby Berkeley sequence. In the audience, Offset stuck out his tongue suggestively.[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]H.E.R., the stage name for the 21-year-old singer and songwriter Gabriella Wilson, led a slow-build version of her ballad “Hard Place.” She won two awards, for R&B performance (in the song “Best Part”) and best R&B album, for her self-titled release “H.E.R.” But when accepting R&B album, she seemed almost baffled that it was eligible.“It’s not even an album,” she said. “It’s an E.P.”Lady Gaga won the first award of the telecast, best pop duo/group performance, for “Shallow,” her duet with Bradley Cooper from their movie “A Star Is Born.” Tearful, she said she wished Cooper were with her — he was in London for the Baftas, the British film awards — and addressed a theme in the film, in which Cooper plays a singer struggling with addiction.“I’m so proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of artists deal with that and we’ve got to take care of each other.”Diana Ross, appearing in a wide, lacy red gown, celebrated her 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career, “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” Winding up her performance, she ordered those in the crowd to wave their hands, saying: “Together we have no limits. You can learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.”She ended with, “Happy birthday to me!”Dolly Parton had the most cross-generational appeal, singing a five-song medley with Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus and Maren Morris that had Smokey Robinson and the K-pop group BTS all dancing and singing along in the crowd. It ended with a nostalgic singalong on “9 to 5” that seemed to pull in the whole arena.Shortly thereafter, Musgraves won her third Grammy of the night — best country album for “Golden Hour” — and gushingly doled out thanks to her manager, the Grammys and her fans.“I never dreamed that this record would be met with such love, such warmth, such positivity,” Musgraves said.[Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.]All but nine of the Grammys’ 84 awards were given out in a nontelevised ceremony that was attended by few of the night’s big stars. Carlile led the preshow portion with her three wins in the American roots category.“Americana music is the island of the misfit toys; I am such a misfit,” Carlile said, accepting the second award. “It is the music that has shaped my life and made me who I am, and even given me my family.”Lady Gaga and Musgraves each had two early wins. Lady Gaga’s “Joanne (Where Do You Think You’re Goin’?),” a piano version of a song first released more than two years ago, took best pop solo performance, and “Shallow” took best song written for visual media. Musgraves won best country solo performance for “Butterflies” and her “Space Cowboy” took best country song.The score for “Black Panther” also won an award for its composer, Ludwig Göransson.[Here’s a look at the Grammys red carpet.]The preshow awards may be invisible to most of the general public, but they can set important benchmarks in the industry, and have the power to reshape careers among artists in genres far beyond pop radio.One barrier was broken with the award for best engineered album, nonclassical, which went to Beck’s “Colors.” Among its winners was Emily Lazar, a studio veteran who became the first woman to win as mastering engineer in that category.“I am so grateful to be one of the people,” she said, “that young women see and they can say: ‘I can see it. I can be it. That’s a cool career, I want to go do that.’”Claudia Brant, a seasoned songwriter for Latin artists who won best Latin pop album for “Sincera,” noted that for all the Grammys’ power, it is the daily studio work that matters the most.“Of course it’s going to change my career, because it’s the biggest recognition I’ve ever gotten,” Brant said. “But tomorrow I’ll have a session in the studio with another artist that’s looking for good songs.”The Grammys missed a chance for another milestone in the producer of the year category. The award went to Pharrell Williams. Had it gone to Linda Perry, she would have been the first woman to take home that award.[Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.]AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationBy The Learning NetworkWe know we tell you every week how much we love reading your responses to our writing prompts, but some weeks are special.Maybe it was the questions we asked, but all of us at The Learning Network agree that you posted especially moving descriptions of your lives and experiences this time around. We loved, too, how you responded to each other, respectfully acknowledging differences and seeking out common ground. If only all discussions on the Internet could be like this.On the day we acknowledge the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting, we hope that what Amira from Northbrook  wrote in response to our question  about family is true: “I feel that as a society we’re starting to become more caring towards one another.”So a warm welcome and thank you to some of the newer classes who joined us — Chicago; East View Academy; Glen Ellyn, Ill.; Horsham, Penn.; Lathrop, Calif.; Media, Penn.; Patino High School in Fresno, Calif.; San Jose, Calif.; and Sarasota, Fla., — and gratitude to the classes who keep the conversation going week after week: Bryant, Ark.; Danvers, Mass.; Hoggard High School in Wilmington, N.C.; Julia R. Masterman Secondary School in Philadelphia; Northbrook, Ill.; and Providence, R.I.Though we won’t be publishing our Current Events Conversation roundup next week as many schools in the U.S. are off, we’ll be back on Feb. 28 with an edition that includes two week’s-worth of comments. See you then!Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________According to a recent survey, the definition of the American dream is changing — from the opportunity for material success and social mobility to the “freedom of choice in how to live” — and many believe that they are living it.We asked students: What does the American dream mean to you? Some shared intimate stories of their parents and grandparents immigrating to the United States and achieving success through hard work and sacrifice. Others dared to imagine lives that were about more than status and wealth.In the United States, the opportunity for a better lifeThe American dream has always been the motto that has pushed my mother and father everyday of their lives. My mom, a village girl from India growing up never gave a thought to come to America because usually it was impossible. Even though my dad had a good life growing up, in India usually the people who had a lot of money were only able to go to America. While my mother was in college she read through so many textbooks about American doctors and watched the news late at night to learn English dreaming one day to go to America. When my parents got married and came to America all they had with them was a suitcase filled with some clothes and a picture of their family. While settling in they were on their own to find an apartment, job, money and other necessities because they had n family or friends in California. There were also instances were my parents went into debt they had decided 1 time to go back to India and they have cried many nights as well. Thanks to my parents believing in the American dream I was able to become a US citizen and now live a happy life in Philadelphia.— Eleena John, Philly, PAI have witnessed the American dream in action. My father was born in Hungary to a mother and father that were both survivors of the holocaust. His father was liberated from Auschwitz and his mother from Bergen Belsen. My father came to America with nothing but a pair of black pants and a white shirt. He stayed with his uncle for 3 years and eventually put himself through college and medical school. He has created a successful practice and makes enough money to support my family everyday. That is the American dream. To build yourself up from absolutely nothing, to grind for every last penny in order to make your dreams a reality. I witnessed the American dream first hand. I watched a man battle from one of the deepest holes imaginable in order to give his children the opportunity to have a better life than he did.— Tibor K, Glenbrook North HighschoolI think that the American dream can happen, but only if you work hard and try to reach that goal. My grandmother was originally from Lithuania and lived on a farm. When she was about 15, her family decided to come to America because of her country getting overrun with communists. She took a huge steamship crowded with thousands of people just to make it to New York. She then started working in a factory and living off food stamps. Her life might have been difficult but in the end, she moved to Philadelphia and met my grandfather who had my mom and aunts and uncles. This is an example of the American dream actually happening to someone just like me or you. My grandmother had to work her way to achieve this experience, she did not sit around on the couch and binge watch Netflix all day. To achieve the American dream, you have to try to achieve what you want in life and want to achieve it, you can’t sit around and wait for things to happen to you, you have to make those things happen to you.— Ona Stocovaz, J.R MastermanOpportunity isn’t available to everyoneI used to believe in the American dream; I used to believe that living in American meant that you could make something of yourself with ease. The American dream does not exist in my eyes, it’s a concept used to motivate people in a volatile economy and favored society. It used to exist, though … My grandfather came to the United States from Greece with not even a dollar to his name. He came to the “land of opportunity” in 1969, hoping to support his family and give them a life which was unavailable in 20th century Grecian poverty. Within a decade he created a family run pizzeria chain, bringing success to his life, his family’s, and the community. But, all of this came from tremendous hard work and determination, something I believe our newer generations lack. But what can one do in an era where cost of living is the highest it’s ever been? How much motivation can one hold when a living wage job is rare without a college degree, which leaves one in debt for years? The American dream existed in a time where it was realistic to live a balanced, successful life. Now, we’re in an age of economic bias with little social mobility; making it big is increasingly unachievable.— Alexandra Pechlivanidis, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC… Depending on your identity and background, it could be more difficult to achieve the American dream. As a woman, it might be harder for me to achieve the same American dream as a man. In theory, the American dream is attainable for everyone, but I’m not sure everyone can achieve the same version of the American dream.— Colleen, Northbrook ILThe American dream of 2019When I was younger, the American Dream consisted of a few things: wealth, possessions, and power, all things similar to what was mentioned in the article. But as I’m getting older, and as our world is changing, my perspective is changing along with it. Of course it’s nice to have nice things. Who wouldn’t want to be able to buy whatever they wanted whenever they wanted for whoever they wanted? But today, as I see people in our world facing violence and injustice everyday, my idea of the American Dream is a little different.To me, the American Dream is having the ability to be safe and healthy, to not have to fear for my life everyday, to have access to the basic resources I need to survive. When I see people across the world, people in the same country as me, even people in my own community faced with violence and injustice, I start to notice how privileged I am compared to others. Maybe I don’t have all the nicest things or all the money in the world, maybe I don’t even have a little bit of it. But, I have access to the resources I need, I have a family, and I have a stable home. And that’s enough for me.— Libby Roth, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCNow that I am older and can understand what is going on in the world, I know that the idea of the “American Dream” is different for everyone. People that come to America to live the “Dream” don’t have the mindset of a white picketed fence, these people are coming here for more opportunities. The “Dream” for some people is to come here for a more prosperous life, that includes having more jobs for that require many different skills, or maybe to leave a warring country. The more modernized “American Dream” does not depict images of becoming wealthy, but more likely of having a happy, fun, and enjoyable life, which is also a healthier and more reachable goal of living than the expectation of living up to the classic “American Dream.” I believe that whatever someone wants there “American Dream” to be, that’s what it is to them. Everyone does not need to have the same dream.— Jenny Braswell, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCThis article definitely made me reconsider my views on the American dream. Now I picture the American dream as equality and safety for all, with loving family and friends that are supportive of all endeavors. My current definition of the American dream seems attainable. I have loving, supportive parents and friends that care about me deeply. People of different ethnicities, religions, and sexualities are climbing the social/political/economic ladder and beginning to reap the same benefits as others. As we progress in our efforts for true equality and lack of prejudices, I have hope that my generation will be able to make this not only the American dream, but the American reality.— Caitlyn Pellerin, Danvers, MAI think the American dream has evolved throughout every generation and that it’s a relative concept. My definition of the American dream is different from my parents because when I think about my mom and my grandparents, their dream was to get to America and have a better life. They achieved their American dream. My parents have managed to give my brother and me a better life than they had, not just financially, but a different way of growing up. When I think about what I believe is my American dream, I picture myself fulfilled in whatever I choose to be doing in my future. Whether it’s having a successful career or a family, as long as I am independent and thriving I’ll achieve my American dream. I think the American dream is something worth striving for, but I also believe that it’s something people have to create their own definitions for; everyone is different, and people have different dreams.— Sarah G, Northbrook, ILWe have grown up having crazy imaginations. These imaginations were never destined to be our reality. We grew up dreaming of unicorns and princesses, luxury and wealth. Money and gold became our everything and that’s all we thought about when we were younger as if these dreams could arise. My sister, for example, loves to sing. Her whole life she dreamed about going on American Idol or The Voice. To pursue her dream of becoming famous and filling the world with her amazing voice. But once we are truly able to dissect the lives of those that are famous, surrounded by luxury, I feel very bad for them. Like a grotesque dream. The Kardashians for example. Their whole life has been on camera, all the bad displayed to the world the second it happens. Constantly changing their bodies with procedures. Constantly fitting the world and all of its desires. But imagine a world where you were with the person you love most, holding hands, never letting go. The touch and warmth of them making you feel like home. Like nothing in this world can ever inhibit your goals. The real American dream is to enjoy the luxuries together. To inhabit the most love that your body can handle and to relish in it.— Elona K, Glenbrook North High School__________On Feb. 4, the British government announced that, alongside mathematics, science and history, students in England would now be learning mindfulness in school. We asked students if they would want to take a such a class and if they thought all schools should do more to improve students’ well-being.They overwhelmingly said yes — taking a break during the day, having a moment for self-reflection, gaining skills to manage stress and learning how to talk about mental health would all be immensely beneficial for their overall well-being. But a few cautioned against viewing mindfulness classes as the be-all-end-all solution to mental illness.A class on mindfulness? Sign me up!Yes! As a high school student, I know that so many teenagers suffer from some form of mental illness and are not getting the help they need. My neighbor recently was hospitalized for depression and was taken out of school for a least three weeks. She, like too many others, reach this breaking point because we aren’t taught how to take care of ourselves mentally …The question isn’t “should” schools have a mindfulness class; it’s “why” we don’t have one already. To be honest, if schools really cared about their student’s overall wellbeing, then a mindfulness class is a no-brainer. We are not just learning sponges that suck up information all day. We are humans too. Just as schools teach us about the world around us, they must also teach us about ourselves. It’s time to actually take action and find solutions to this ongoing mental concern.— Lili, ILTime in the day to put my mind at ease, especially during the most chaotic seven hours of the day would make a huge impact on my mood, grades, energy, and desire to function in general. I feel that schools setting a time for mindfulness and meditation classes is a great idea, one that many students would appreciate and find helpful. The mental pause in between studying for tests and analyzing writing would help in countless ways some for me personally being; more energetic, happier, less stressed, and better management over my schoolwork and grades, all making this practice time an even better idea.— Lilli Peluso, MassachusettsMental health is crucial to every living person. For our entire lives in school, we have taken Physical Education to equip ourselves with methods of staying physically healthy in the future. This class trains students to get up and be active for long-term continuation, but there is not significant attention being put toward mental health. Especially in high school, students (often) feel pressured to do their best, receive the best grades, be the most social, win the most competitions and maintain a happy persona. In reality, these pressures are incredibly detrimental to our mental health as we begin to focus our efforts on perfection over improvement. I believe that we should learn, early on in life, how to balance stress. A mental health class in high school can 1) help improve our mentalities in the present moment and 2) teach us how to cope with difficulties later on in life.— Sami L., NorthbrookTeaching mindfulness is an essential addition to every school’s curriculum. Learning to reflect and understand one’s self is arguable more important than perhaps a physics lesson … Why learn chemistry equations when I could be spending my time pursuing and developing what I am actually passionate about. But a class in mindfulness has life-long benefits for all. Girls, guys, doctors, teachers, performers, lawyers, accountants, you, and me would benefit immensely, taking a pause during our crazy lives to live in the present and reflect upon the moment.— Alexis, NorthbrookInstead of putting academic studies as first priority, schools should create a balance between mindfulness and academic studies. By creating a balance, school could be made into a happy environment where there is a change of behavior, concentration levels, and self-esteem. Not only will this benefit students but it will also benefit the entire school as well. Statistics have shown that schools that have included mindfulness sessions in a school day have a result of 50% fewer rule infractions, 38% fewer suspension days, 25% fewer absentee days, and better performance on attention tests like the ADD-H Teacher-Ratings scale.— Alissa, PAA five-minute mental check-in at the beginning of the day may not seem like much, but it could force a student to examine their own state. Are they hungry? Have they been neglecting breakfast? Did they sleep? With the amount of work, responsibilities, and social obligations most teens face, we often don’t get a moment of rest and self-reflection until our head hits the pillow at the end of the day. Mindfulness and the ability to take a second to be aware of our physical presence and mental state are important.— Faye, ChicagoBreaking the taboo of mental illnessI believe if this program starts, then we can better express our emotions and be more open to ourselves and others about our mental health.My elementary school had a class similar to what the article was discussing. It was a weekly class were the teacher talks us through how to handle certain situations about bullying, being aware of others feelings and being able to talk about what’s affecting us. From these classes, a foundation was created to be mindful of others and to be comfortable about talking with them. With these skills, I became an aware and comforting person to chat with about mental health problems. Hopefully, others will see my efforts and learn to do the same.— Kathryn Meehan, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCMental health is a topic that many still find taboo or unimportant. Most students struggle with making sure they get all their work done, being social, and at the same time taking care of themselves. In my own experience, taking care of myself did not take priority and my mental health suffered because of that. My school had never taught me how to deal with all of the work they were giving me, they just assumed I’d be able to handle everything even though I’d never had to before. Schools should begin including mindfulness in education, maybe not as a core class, but as something to think about. Some of my teachers now have meditation at the beginning of class for a few minutes where we think about our breathing and just calm ourselves down before the day starts. Just a slight change like that can make a huge difference. Making sure that parents, teachers, and students are all educated on mental health and mindfulness is really the best way to help students with their stress and anxiety.— Amelia, Northbrook, ILHaving a specific class dedicated to mindfulness would also bring up the subject on mental health in a more positive way. It would decrease the stigma around it and would help let students know that it’s okay to talk about and they would feel more open to talk about it. Overall, having a class about mindfulness would be really beneficial.— Alyssa Rich, Danvers, MABreathing exercises don’t address the root of teenage stressI’m not sure mindfulness is the solution we need to alleviate students’ stress. Yes, practicing mindfulness has its merits, and I think there is value in having a class dedicated for that, but there are limitations. My school has an ultracompetitive atmosphere, sometimes toxic and cutthroat. Mindfulness can help with symptoms of stress, but the root cause should be tackled as well. To be honest, practicing mindfulness doesn’t seem to be for me. I don’t find my stress levels to decrease or for my wellbeing to be, at the very least, okay. College, homework load, jobs, family obligations, and socializing — these things are not disappearing when I’m meditating.— Eugene, IllinoisWhile I believe that learning mindfulness in school holds value, this type of meditation alone cannot suffice the complex stress and pressure that young adults face as they grow in adolescence. True, simple tactics of breathing exercises may benefit manageable cases like random sparks of nervosity, but complex struggles such as ongoing bullying, OCD, or internal phobias may require less independent exercises and more deep discussion with others from counseling to therapy.— Tabitha Waite, Bryant High School, ARAs a high school student I don’t think schools should teach mindfulness, because I don’t think it can really help students with stress. Yes us students do suffer high stress levels, but personally mindfulness hasn’t given me positive results. I’ve found other ways to deal with stress that are more productive then mindfulness, such as exercising and sleeping enough. I can’t speak for everyone, but personally I believe schools should NOT teach mindfulness. And if they do some students will benefit while others won’t.— Oscar, Florida__________In her essay for The Edit, “What’s a ‘Normal’ Family, Anyway?” Claire Huag writes, “My family isn’t exactly traditional, and I’m better for it.” In this Student Opinion question, we asked students what they thought.Below, we’ve included many of their comments to demonstrate the point so many of them sought to make: There is no single definition of family — who you count as your people and the role they play in your life is different for everyone and entirely up to you.Many definitions of “family”I believe that there are two kinds of family, the family your born with, and the family that you can choose. I think that these two things overlap frequently, but truly the only family that matters is the family and company that you choose to keep. You could be born to a family that neglects you, but while they would always be your biological family, your friends could form a more powerful closer family. While this is my interpretation of family, it is also my opinion that you are entitled to your own opinion, but so is everyone else. This basically means that what works for you works for you, but you can’t force it to work for others.— Samuel Hamilton, MastermanA family, in my opinion, is one or more people that you can connect to and act truly like yourself in front of.— June Lee, Glenbrook High SchoolFamily to me are the one who comfort me the ones who understand my struggles and who keep me company.— Rebecca, Northbrook ILI define the word family as people you would choose spend time with, take a bullet for and never get sick of.— Phaelan, NorthbrookSomeone who is “like family” to you can be defined as someone who you can rely on, someone who you can always trust, or ask for advice or support whenever need be. It is someone who you love, and someone who loves you, someone who is always willing to do anything for you, and is someone who you can move mountains for.— Hanna Sh, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PAFamily is an extension of you. A representation that no matter who you are or where you come from. A part of you.— Claira, IllinoisFamily should be shaped around what you need them to be for you. If you’re upset, they should be your shoulder to lean on. If you’re happy, they should be there to stretch the happiness out for as long as them. Family is love, and that love should stick until the world ends.— Lev, Chicago, ILFamily to me is someone who is willing to support you with what you are doing, but are also willing to correct your mistakes if you are making mistakes.— Rachel Widjaja, Masterman, Philadelphia… A family is the people who you can always turn to when you feel like there is nobody left in the world. They are the people who can always be there, whether that means that they are friends or related to you in a definitive way.— Lily Chancey, Philadelphia, MastermanI think that there are more important pieces to family than the gender, orientation, number of parents, and area of residence. Things like stability, interest, respect, involvement, and care. Any family, no matter the makeup, can fulfill (or fail to fulfill) these.— Emma Johnson, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCPeople say that “blood is thicker than water” but I prefer the alternate version: “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” … Nobody should associate with people that hurt them over and over because of some gene-related societal obligation. Those who love and support you are your family, and not necessarily those who are related to you.— Natasha A., Bryant, ARWhat does your family look like?In my eyes, family is defined as love. Not just any love, but unconditional love. Unconditional love means that no matter what happens, (people change, people move away, you spend years apart, someone does something horrible, etc.), you will still love one another.I have spent the last ten years dancing with the same group of people. We have had many ups and downs, which is expected with a large group of 12 year old girls. To be honest, a lot of us would probably not be friends if we did not dance. Although we may not be the best of friends, we are all still connected. It is almost unsettling when you sacrifice for people you would not normally like. However, in my experience, you do not have to like someone to love them. To love someone means to respect them. Each of us have tremendous respect for one another. All of us try our best to understand one another and to appreciate the others values and opinions even if we disagree.— Bella, Glen Ellyn, IlMy family is made up of two parents and four children, and I am the only biological kid from both of my parents. One of my siblings is adopted from Puerto Rico, and my other two siblings have a different mom than I do. But that doesn’t make our love or support any weaker. I never call my half siblings my “half siblings” and I never call my adopted brother my “adopted brother”. We are a family, regardless of blood, and we love and support each other no matter what.— Jayne, Northbrook, ILBecause of the fact that I was never close with my dad, I often leaned on my uncle for support and continued to do so to this day. He was the one who always understood me, who listened to me, who made me feel important as a young girl growing up in a complex society. He taught me lessons about life that I could not be more grateful to have learned from him. My point is, my uncle, being like a father figure to me growing up taught me that family doesn’t always have to be a mother, a father, and a brother or sister.— Maya, NorthbrookI have experienced family in many aspects. One example of family within my life could be my football team that I am a member of. During the season we are together for 3 to 5 hours a day at practice or a games. In the season we experienced an injury within the team. The injury was very sad moment because he was sent to the hospital mid game and was a cause for the people to work harder and play better in the game. It sucked seeing him leave, and directly after the game I felt a pain in my gut telling me I needed to go see him in the hospital. Thinking back on this now I realize that this feeling was caused by the fact that I thought of him as my brother on and off the field. We both worked out together, and pushed each other into being successful. Along with everybody else I felt like I would sacrifice anything for him at that point because there was nothing else but to hope for him to get better.— Jacob Stone, United StatesFamily is about being there for each other when they are in need. I have not seen family in traditional sense for almost the entirety of my life. From struggles like divorce and adoption and only seeing my siblings and mother every other week and many others, we are still family. We still support and love one another even if hard times create a disconnect. I have also seen family in biological aspects. A few years ago I set my mind out to find my biological family. I feel as if they are an extension to my family. I feel a bond with my biological brothers and biological parents in a different sense then with my actual family that not many people will understand. Family is about a connection you feel, whether through love and support or biological.— Taylor D, Northbrook, ILFamily. Family is the feeling of comfort with a person. Having trust in a person. Being able to go to your home and to know you can give your family a hug. That they love you and you love them. Family is the friends that are always there for you. I have a couple of those. One of them is named Maeve. She is a bundle of joy to my day. She’s my coffee every day. I know that we are like sisters. Like family. I have another friend and her name is Olivia. She is a kid in a candy shop. She has so much joy and happiness that she shares with everyone. She is a true friend. She is family that will always be in my heart.— Jenesis Moreno, Masterman; Philadelphia, PAMy family at first glance would seem, by society’s standards, normal. As a kid I thought the same thing, two parents, grandparents on both sides of the family along with cousins, and a sibling. For years I grew up getting to know these people and how they related to me, however one day I was told that my grandmother wasn’t actually related to me … To me it didn’t matter if she was my ‘normal’ blood realized grandma, instead she was the person who only loved me, which made her my grandma.— Benjamin Blankenship, Hoggard High, Wilmington, NCIn my life my step-dad is who I call “dad” and has been my best friend, biggest role model, and biggest supporter my entire life, but none of this is based on blood because it really doesn’t have to as long as you act as a family in your actions. My step-dad has never treated me any differently than his biological kids and in a way knowing that he cares so much about me even when I’m not his biological daughter makes the connection even more special.— Paula, NorthbrookMy dog is not blood related to me so does that mean I can’t call her family? I don’t see why not because I love her with all my heart and would be devastated if anything happened to her. Family is about love in my opinion.— Alex Lee, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC… My immediate family would include my mom, dad, sister, and I. I also have four grandparents, three uncles, one aunt, and two cousins related by blood. But instead of just blood related family, I have lots of family who aren’t blood related to me at all. One of my great-grandmothers had three husbands throughout her life, making my grandfather have a stepbrother. Another one of my grandmothers’ mother had died when she was very young, so she had a stepmother growing up and barely remembered her biological mother. I even have several uncles who aren’t uncles at all - they are just very close friends of my dad. All of these non-blood related relatives are connected by love - which is why I think a family does not have to be biological, it could just be made up of the people you love.— Kaya Perelman, Masterman School, PhiladelphiaWhat role does your family play in your life?I think a family is similar to a tree. In life, you will go on countless journeys with experiences involving tons of different people from different backgrounds, gaining knowledge and perspective. But this life can be overwhelming, and having a system you can depend on is essential. Like a tree, a family is something you can lean on for its entire existence.— Ethan, Northbrook, ILMy family is my foundation for my life, because if the world beats you down to nothing, you always have that foundation. I think that friends are a little less important than family, because family is always first. Whether it is your actual family or not, family is first.— Joseph Foglietta, Danvers, MAThe family we create by choice are just as important as the people who we are directly related to by blood. Sometimes I can’t tell my family serious problems because most of them are a different generation so they just can’t understand your modern day problems. This is also why the family we meet and communicate to by choice is so much easier to connect with. They are living in the same world as you and you are most likely going through very similar problems as you. At the end of the day, whoever you consider being your family, will always show you this unconditional love and endless support that will keep you moving forward in life.— Kristina Kitsul, Masterman PhiladelphiaAdvertisementSupported byBy Annie KarniWASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Tuesday morning that the husband of one of his top aides, Kellyanne Conway, was a “total loser.” On Wednesday morning, he doubled down, describing him as a “stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!”The husband in question, George T. Conway III, a prominent conservative lawyer, has been publicly critical of Mr. Trump for months. But in recent days he has escalated those attacks on Twitter by reigniting a conversation about the president’s mental health and saying Mr. Trump was a malignant narcissist who fits the profile for narcissistic personality disorder.Aides have been pressing Mr. Trump to simply ignore Mr. Conway, who in a phone interview on Tuesday said he viewed it as a “badge of honor” to be called a loser by someone he believes is unfit to hold the nation’s highest office, and said the president’s reaction only “proves the point I made yesterday.”Mr. Trump’s attack on Mr. Conway was not unusual for the language he used or for the medium through which he employed it. Over the past two years, Mr. Trump has proved that trivial, personal fights are not a distraction from the work he is doing in office, but a core feature of the image he wants to project.He called Rex W. Tillerson, his former secretary of state, “dumb as a rock” and “lazy as hell” after Mr. Tillerson criticized him in an interview last December for being undisciplined. He has taken the bait on almost every negative book written about him by a former staff member or a journalist, helping to elevate those tomes to the best-seller lists by declaring, via Twitter, that their authors are “a mess!” (Cliff Sims), a “lowlife” (Omarosa Manigault Newman) or an “idiot” (Bob Woodward).Returning fire with fire is part of the president’s modus operandi that aides around him have internalized. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump made clear that he would hit back at criticism, even if the critic was the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest-serving aides.Singling out Ms. Conway’s husband for presidential critique put the focus back on one of Washington’s most discussed marriages, even as Ms. Conway has tried to defuse the coverage of her husband by not commenting about him on the record because, she has told friends, of how it would affect her children.Mr. Trump appeared to be provoked by a tweet from his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who wrote: “We all know that @realDonaldTrump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn’t want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn’t even know him!”In fact, Mr. Conway withdrew his name from consideration for a top job at the Justice Department, running its civil division, before he ever started. And he has known Mr. Trump for decades, since he lived in Manhattan at Trump World Tower and declined to sit on the condo board, a spot that his wife took in his stead.In more recent history, Mr. Conway spent time with Mr. Trump on election night and at the wedding of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in June 2017, when Mr. Trump even commended him on turning down the job because it would have meant reporting to a “weak” leader, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Since Mr. Conway has become more vocal in his criticism of the president, Mr. Trump has referred to him repeatedly as “Mr. Kellyanne Conway” and claimed that in his diatribes against the president, he is simply trying to gain attention through the reflected glory of his wife. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Mr. Conway, “often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted.”In an interview, Mr. Conway dismissed the idea that he was coasting off interest in his wife, and said that in the course of a long marriage, it is hard to separate who is responsible for whose fortune and fame.“The way we structured our lives before the campaign, it enabled her to build her business so she could become the campaign manager,” said Mr. Conway, who was previously a partner at the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. “I helped in ways that enabled her to go off and be the campaign manager, and go off to the White House in the spring of 2017.”When the couple relocated its family to Washington from New Jersey, Mr. Conway gave up his partner status at the law firm, which does not have an office in the District of Columbia, and became “of counsel.”Mr. Conway said his motivation to publicly attack the president had been driven, at least in part, by feeling responsible for having played a small role in electing him, even if it was a tangential one of supportive spouse to the campaign manager.“There is a little bit of guilt there,” he said. “There’s some of that.”“He wasn’t my first choice,” Mr. Conway added. “He wasn’t her first choice. He was the last choice, in terms of the last person standing.” But Mr. Conway said his wife was now all-in for the president, much to his chagrin. “At this point, yes she is,” he said.Ms. Conway, who led a briefing on Mr. Trump’s initiative to stop opioid abuse on Tuesday morning and was set to personally brief the president on the administration’s achievements later in the day, declined to comment. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Ms. Conway said she did not share her husband’s view of the president’s mental health.Critics of Mr. Conway have noted that Mr. Trump revealed himself fully during the campaign, and has not changed. What has changed, in fact, is Mr. Conway’s view of him.“I had assumed and hoped that the gravity of the office would lead him to something greater,” Mr. Conway said. “That respect for the office, respect for history and the desire to leave a legacy would lead him to see that there is something beyond himself that he needs to achieve.” But Mr. Conway said that “on Day 1, his focus on the crowds, it was clear almost instantaneously that he’s not capable of it.”A lifelong Republican, Mr. Conway said he had not ruled out supporting a Democrat in 2020. “It depends on what they say,” he said, “but under no circumstances would I vote or support Trump.”Some followers of the White House’s personal dramas believe the Conways are playing both sides and looking for a big payday if Ms. Conway decides to leave the administration. But Mr. Conway said that a Mary Matalin-James Carville-style road show was an unlikely outcome.“I almost wish that were so,” he said. “This is just my way of expressing my views about something I find thoroughly maddening, which is the utter incompetence and mendacity of the president and the administration. I don’t end up getting in arguments at home about it.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's first baby, due later this spring, will almost surely extend a long tradition of supporting royal causes, but those same customs will constrain the new prince or princess when it comes to politics.Meghan Markle used her celebrity to back Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and attacked Donald Trump as "misogynistic" and "divisive." The Los Angeles-born actress has worked as an ambassador for United Nations Women and the charity World Vision.A pregnant Markle, speaking in March on an International Women's Day panel at King's College, London, addressed the likelihood that her child will grow up learning gender equality as much as the ABCs."I'd seen this documentary on Netflix about feminism and one of the things they said during pregnancy was 'I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism,'" Markle said. "I love that. So boy or girl or whatever it is, we hope that that's the case, with our little bump."But commenting on international politics could get her into trouble with the royal household.POLITICALLY INCORRECTThe royal family for years has backed charities with social causes, and Queen Elizabeth has been patron or president of more than 600 of them, ranging from wildlife groups and sporting bodies to military organizations.But the royals are expected to steer well clear of politics, despite a long history of politically incorrect blunders. Harry had to apologize in January 2009 after a newspaper published video footage showing him referring to Asian army comrades with derogatory language. He also was pilloried for wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party, a gaffe that sparked a global outcry."There's no problem with Meghan speaking out on feminism, social justice and equality issues, but if she starts getting political she'll be in hot water," said Katie Nicholl, author of "Harry: Life, Loss, and Love." "The Queen is politically neutral. She expects her family to be the same."Meghan seems to see activism as a family affair."Harry and I see the world so similarly in our approach of being very hands-on with things," Meghan said in February at a forum at the Royal Foundation.MAKE MOTHER PROUDHarry and his elder brother William have followed in the footsteps of their mother Diana, whose work with AIDS and HIV patients and tackling landmines won global attention. In 2017, the princes led a campaign to erase the stigma of mental health illness and spoke of their personal struggle following their mother's death in a Paris car crash in 1997.The Royal Foundation, which the princes run with their wives, aims to combat cyberbullying, and supports wildlife conservation, the military and other causes.Even the start of Meghan and Harry's romance had roots in a social cause. They slipped off to Botswana shortly after they began dating in July 2016 in what Harry described as a "crucial" chance to get to know one another. Harry, who first visited the southern African country when he was 13, two months after his mother's death, is a patron of Rhino Conservation Botswana."It feels very second nature for that child to continue their efforts," said Mahogany Browne, a Brooklyn-based poet and author of "Woke Baby," a board book encouraging the littlest progressives to toddle in pursuit of social justice.AdvertisementSupported byBy Ali Winston[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Jason Reeves, 32, struggled for years to find his way, frequently running afoul of the law and grappling with mental health issues.In spite of it all, his mother, Paulette, stood by him, trying to help her son climb out of his personal morass.This month, everything came crashing down.On Wednesday, detectives knocked on the door of the fourth-floor apartment Mr. Reeves shared with his 67-year-old mother in the Albany Houses, a public housing complex in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Her co-workers had reported her missing after Ms. Reeves, who worked as a lunch aide at a nearby middle school, failed to show up for work.Mr. Reeves answered the door. He explained that his mother was away in Florida, but the detectives noticed “an odor of rotting flesh,” according to court documents, and entered the apartment. Inside a closet, they found Ms. Reeves’s charred, mutilated body. She had been stabbed several times in her chest, face and eyes, the documents said.Upon searching the bathroom, the police found bloodstains and burn marks inside and above the bathtub. More bloodstains were visible throughout the apartment, where Ms. Reeves’s body had apparently been dragged from the bathroom to the closet, according to the court documents. After taking her son into custody and transporting him to the 77th Precinct for questioning, detectives noticed blood on his clothing, the documents said.Mr. Reeves was arraigned on Friday afternoon in Brooklyn Criminal Court on charges of second-degree murder and held without bail. Gaunt-faced and bearded, a handcuffed Mr. Reeves shuffled into the courtroom wearing a white Tyvek jumpsuit and plastic foot coverings, which had been given to him in lieu of his bloodstained clothes.His lawyer, Stuart Rubin of Brooklyn Defender Services, declined to comment on the charges against his client.Ms. Reeves had long tried to help her son move past his problems, according to several neighbors and acquaintances. A churchgoer and devoted mother who immigrated from Jamaica when Jason was a child, she witnessed her son’s struggle with mental illness and brushes with the law, both in southern Florida and in New York City.The family moved around often after arriving in the United States. In 2004, Ms. Reeves and her husband, Barry Reeves, filed for divorce in Broward County, Fla.After separating from Jason’s father, Ms. Reeves fell behind on a subprime mortgage and sold her house in South Florida for a loss, according to property records. She moved north, first settling in the Bronx from July 2008 through the fall of 2011, when she moved to the Albany Houses in Crown Heights.Her son stayed behind in Florida, often running into trouble with the authorities. A review of court records showed that Mr. Reeves faced several separate felony charges of battery, burglary, domestic violence, assault, robbery with a firearm and domestic violence from 2005 through 2008. Some of his early offenses were prosecuted through a specialized mental health court in Broward County, and in 2006 he was institutionalized by the courts after being found mentally incompetent to stand trial, according to court records.By September 2010, Mr. Reeves had moved north to the Bronx to live with his mother. He was arrested again that month, suspected of breaking and entering into a ground-floor apartment in the northeast Bronx. He and his mother moved to the Albany Houses in Brooklyn in 2011, but two years later, Mr. Reeves was arrested on suspicion of burglarizing a factory in Greenpoint.During the past year, Mr. Reeves began to use crack openly, stopped washing and became threatening and erratic, acquaintances and neighbors said. More than once, his mother approached young men who hung out in the lobby and stairwells of her building, asking them for help with her son.A neighbor, Asia Djones, said she heard Ms. Reeves say to the young men that if they were selling drugs, “please don’t sell my son drugs.”Toward the end of last summer, Mr. Reeves started dropping weight and getting new tattoos. He began menacing his neighbors, they said, snatching pocketbooks, drinking openly and hustling people in the building for money.Last year, according to neighbors, his mother sent him back to Jamaica in hopes that he would find peace. It didn’t work. Ms. Reeves told her friends that her son had been beaten within an inch of his life over drugs, leaving him with missing teeth and a newly misshapen face.Mr. Reeves’s behavior grew so menacing in recent months that his mother began to fear for her safety, one of her friends, Jacqueline Cunningham, recounted in an interview. “I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m nervous,” Ms. Cunningham said Ms. Reeves told her. “She said, ‘I think that boy is going to kill me.’”On Oct. 5, the police responded to a 911 call at the apartment shared by Ms. Reeves and her son. Neighbors said that Jason was taken away in an ambulance to a mental hospital for treatment. Within days, he had returned to the Albany Houses and resumed his cycle of drug abuse, petty larceny and erratic behavior, they said.Last weekend, when his mother disappeared, Mr. Reeves wandered around the neighborhood as usual, neighbors said. He chucked cigarette butts around the lobby, walked to the store to buy beer and tried to sell gift cards for whatever he could get for them on the street.But he had something new to say.AdvertisementSupported byNATIONALAn article on Tuesday about the struggle to build a transit line between Durham, N.C., and Chapel Hill, N.C., attributed an erroneous distinction to Mark-Anthony Middleton, a Durham City Council member.

You’re viewing someone else’s picks for how they would spend Trump’s border wall money. Jump to their picks.Is an additional $5.7 billion for a border wall really the best way to protect Americans? While President Trump is playing with billions of dollars and millions of lives, I decided to play with that money, too – to advance the greater good.Here’s our own toy wall, which may be as real as Trump’s will ever be, and what we’d use the money for.I propose allocating the $5.7 billion in ways that I believe would be far more effective in benefiting Americans and the world. Below, you can use a calculator to make your own choices. It’s thrilling to hand out billions! (Jump right to the calculator.)Each large brick represents about $50 million of the$5.7 billion that Trump is seeking for the border wall$250 millionon alternative border security$1.03 billionto save livesaround theworld$2.2 billion onAmerica’s kids$359 millionto reducepathways tocrime$1.38 billion to improve securityfor Americans$486 millionon otherprogramsEach large brick represents about $50 million of the $5.7 billionthat Trump is seeking for the border wall$250 millionon alternative border security$1.03 billionto save livesaround theworld$2.2 billion onAmerica’s kids$359 millionto reducepathways tocrime$1.38 billion to improve securityfor Americans$486 millionon otherprogramsAlternative bordersecurity$250M$2.2 billionHelp America’s kids$359MPreventcrime$1.03BSavelivesabroad$1.38 billion Improve security$486MOtherEach large brick represents about $50 millionof the $5.7 billion that Trump is seekingfor the border wall$250 millionAnti-gang programin Central America$250MAnti-gang programin Central AmericaGang violence in Central America drives much of the immigration across our southern border, so let’s invest in proven programs that can reduce that violence. A much-studied program called Cure Violence achieved 45 percent reductions in violent crime in Trinidad and Tobago and up to 90 percent reductions in shootings in Honduras.Additional anti-gang initiatives in Central America could save lives, reduce the “push factors” that drive migrants and reduce the need for border security — all at a much lower cost than a wall.$1.12 billionDrug treatmentfor mothers withaddiction$11.8 millionGun buybackprograms$250 millionAnti-gangprogramsin the U.S.$11.8MGun buybackprograms$1.12BDrug treatmentfor mothers withaddiction$250MAnti-gangprogramsin the U.S.Drug overdoses kill far more Americans (70,000 a year) than immigrants, terrorists, guns or automobiles, yet only 10 percent of Americans with addictions get specialized treatment. So one way to save American lives and also reduce the crime that often goes with addiction would be to provide treatment that helps people break drug dependency.One of the most successful programs, Women in Recovery, works with moms in Oklahoma who are drug offenders; for each participant, it costs $28,000, lasts 18 months, ends with the woman employed and has only a 4 percent recidivism rate over three years. The children also benefit as their mothers move from addiction to regular jobs — so let’s expand it nationwide.$125 millionLead reduction$234 millionPrisoner jobtraining$234 millionPrisoner jobtraining$125 millionLead reductionMore than half a million American children still are poisoned with lead each year, damaging their brains and increasing the risk that they will become criminals. One study found that a large-scale effort to reduce lead poisoning would save the United States billions of dollars in costs of crime and special education. Likewise, job training for prisoners through the Center for Employment Opportunities costs $6,500 per person and has a good record of turning offenders into taxpayers.$650 millionHome visitingprograms$438 millionContraceptives$650 millionTechnical education$200 millionPermanent housingfor 20,000 homelesspeople$258 millionLiteracy programs$650MHomevisiting$438MContraceptives$650MTechnicaleducation$258MLiteracyprograms$200M PermanenthousingResearch suggests a higher return from investing in education than in walls; early childhood, when the brain is developing, is a particularly crucial window. Home visiting programs like Nurse Family Partnership coach at-risk moms and have an excellent record.Another high-return investment: provide girls who don’t want to get pregnant with long-acting contraception such as IUDs and implants.$270 millionSupplementfor Vitamin A$400 millionContraception$100 millionDeworm 200million children$157 millionEye surgery$100 millionBednets to protectagainst malaria$270MSupplementfor Vitamin A$400MContraception$100MDewormchildren$100MBednets$157MEye surgeryWow! We’re spending our “wall money” so cost-effectively that we have a chance to reserve some for humanitarian causes abroad. For example, millions of people go blind from cataracts, which a five-minute surgery can fix for $50. Similarly, 40 cents will deworm a child for a year, resulting in a kid who is healthier and better able to stay in school. Or vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk that a child in a poor country will die or go blind.$250 millionEnforce taxcompliance$111 millionSocial-impactbonds$100 millionResearch$25 millionDog subsidies formental health$111MSocial-impactbonds$250MEnforce taxcompliance$100MResearch$25MDog subsidies formental healthEven after all that, I have money left over. So let’s get creative.The G.O.P. has sharply cut funding for the I.R.S., so that the audit risk has plunged for zillionaires. The Justice Department estimates that each additional $1 spent on tax compliance brings in an additional $6 in tax revenue. So with a modest investment, we can start all over again spending money!If we start a fund to invest in social-impact bonds and performance-based contracts, we can tap private investors to address America’s needs — and pay only for success.Finally, in a bit of whimsy: experiment with dog subsidies. True, this has not been subjected to randomized trials (any more than the wall). But mental health is underaddressed in America, with suicides at a 30-year high, and what greater comfort is there than a friendly dog?So I challenge you. How would you spend the $5.7 billion to make America better off? You can use all or part of the money to begin to build a wall (credible estimates for the cost of the full wall start at $22 billion), or you can allocate it to whatever area you believe generates the most bang for the buck. Then you can post your results on social media.

This is one of those projects in which all the numbers are difficult – or even impossible – to pin down. We tried hard to get the best cost and impact figures available, but they are estimates and we don’t want to convey a precision that is unrealistic.For example, one of the literacy coaching initiatives I recommend is Reading Partners, which has been much studied and has an excellent record of improving children’s outcomes. Reading Partners told me that the cost per additional child would be $1,600, while an independent research group called MDRC that has studied Reading Partners calculated that the figure would be $320. The difference comes down to what is included (only cash or also in-kind expenses), and whether one calculates just the school cost or also that of outside partners.Likewise, most of the money I allocated went to programs whose effectiveness has been shown in randomized controlled trials, the gold standard of evidence. But randomized trials are expensive and not much repeated (you don’t get tenure if you’re the sixth economist to show that something works), and in any case it’s not always clear that a trial in one location will be valid in another. As a result, there have been “worm wars” about the cost-effectiveness of deworming, and similar disagreements about a number of the other interventions cited.Yet at least these disputes are waged with evidence. The impacts and figures I cite are imperfect but are my best guesses based on the data available. In putting together this project, my colleague Stuart Thompson and I gathered figures from GiveWell, MDRC, ImpactMatters, Social Finance, National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies and others. In contrast, President Trump proposes to spend the $5.7 billion on the basis of no rigorous cost-benefit analysis or research. And what I’ve learned in my career is to go with the evidence, even as you’re skeptical of it.AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew HaagStephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 58 people in a barrage of gunfire from his perch in a Las Vegas hotel suite, had sought infamy and most likely chose his target, an outdoor music festival, because of the image of harming people who were having fun, according to an F.B.I. report released on Tuesday.But after a lengthy investigation, a team of investigators and behavioral analysts could not determine a “single or clear motivating factor” behind Mr. Paddock’s October 2017 attack, the report concluded. In the years before the mass shooting, Mr. Paddock had complained about his declining physical and mental health, which led him to meticulously plan the attack with the explicit intention of committing suicide in the end, the F.B.I. found.“His inability or unwillingness to perceive any alternatives to this ending influenced his decision to attack,” stated the report, which lists 10 findings over three pages. “The planning and preparation — in and of itself — was likely satisfying to Paddock as it provided a sense of direction and control despite his mental and physical decline.”Yet Mr. Paddock left no suicide note, manifesto or communication about the attack or his thinking, investigators said. The F.B.I. report underscored the lingering mystery of the rampage, echoing the frustrations expressed by investigators just days after the attack — that Mr. Paddock had carefully covered his tracks, had not told anyone about his plans and had no obvious motivations.“The L.V.R.P.’s Key Findings illustrate that Paddock was, in many ways, similar to other active shooters the F.B.I. has studied,” the report said, referring to the Las Vegas Review Panel, a group of investigators, psychologists and other experts who analyzed evidence over a year.The report portrays Mr. Paddock as heavily influenced by his father, a notorious bank robber in the 1960s and ’70s who landed on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list, and as being devoid of empathy for others. According to the report, he viewed people much the same way he approached gambling: A life, like every bet, was transactional.That mind-set led him to target the Route 91 Harvest Festival, the country music show below his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.“He had a history of exploiting others through manipulation and duplicity, sometimes resulting in a cruel deprivation of their expectations without warning,” the F.B.I. said in the report.AdvertisementSupported byBy Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni and Michael TackettLIMA, Ohio — It is an obsession he cannot seem to shake.Senator John McCain of Arizona has been dead for seven months, but President Trump’s feud with him is very much alive, and in front of a military audience at a tank plant here in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, he took it to a new level.He said he gave Mr. McCain “the funeral he wanted, and I didn’t get ‘thank you,’” exaggerating the role he played in honoring the senator’s death four days before his 82nd birthday.He blamed him for “a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard.” He said that “McCain didn’t get the job done for our great vets” and the Department of Veterans Affairs. And he was blunt in saying that his animosity toward Mr. McCain was not going to change.“I have to be honest: I’ve never liked him much,” Mr. Trump said, about 10 minutes into a freewheeling speech that was ostensibly about the resurgence of manufacturing jobs. “Hasn’t been for me. I’ve really — probably never will.”The long, antagonistic history between the president and Mr. McCain, in his youth a Navy pilot and prisoner of war celebrated for his bravery and later known as a maverick in the Republican Party, dates to the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, who never served in the military, said Mr. McCain was not a war hero, adding, “I like people who weren’t captured.”Mr. Trump was reacting to the senator’s accusation that he riled up “crazies” with inflammatory remarks about illegal immigration across the Mexican border. His attack on Mr. McCain, the party’s 2008 presidential candidate, horrified his own aides and led Republican leaders to denounce the outsider who was already disrupting their party. It also proved to be an early example of Mr. Trump’s ability to remain undamaged by any self-created controversy.Now, months after Mr. McCain’s death in August, Mr. Trump suddenly cannot stop talking about his old adversary, outraging Mr. McCain’s supporters and creating another divide — if only temporary — between himself and congressional Republicans.His attacks began over the weekend, when the president used his Twitter feed to berate Mr. McCain for his role in giving the F.B.I. a dossier of unverified information about Mr. Trump’s connections to Russia that was compiled by a former British spy — a dossier the F.B.I. already had. He brought up Mr. McCain’s vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. He claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was “last in his class” at the Naval Academy, when Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom.On Tuesday, seated in the Oval Office next to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was “never a fan” of Mr. McCain, and never would be. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated all those reasons in a diatribe that was part of a week that Mr. Trump seems to have dedicated to airing personal feuds.He has spent days criticizing George T. Conway III, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, who has been raising alarms about the president’s mental health and calling him unfit for office via his Twitter feed. On his way to Ohio, Mr. Trump called Mr. Conway a “whack job,” capping two days of back and forth with the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest-serving aides.But his relentless fixation on Mr. McCain was more reminiscent of an election-year feud Mr. Trump escalated against a Gold Star father, Khizr Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention, and, brandishing a pocket Constitution, challenged Mr. Trump for smearing the character of Muslims. Republicans once again denounced Mr. Trump when he continued to attack Mr. Khan and his wife, who Mr. Trump implied was forced against her will to stand silently by her husband’s side during the emotional speech.The feud with Mr. McCain, however, has carried into his presidency, even after the man who was considered an elder statesman of the Senate learned he had brain cancer and eventually died.Planning his funeral, Mr. McCain made it clear that the president would not be welcome, leaving Mr. Trump to fume when his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, eulogized Mr. McCain in a service at Washington National Cathedral. The president’s response was to stall on issuing any proclamation of praise, or ordering flags to be flown at half-staff to commemorate the senator’s death.His posthumous attacks have been cheered at the president’s Make America Great rallies. But at the army tank plant in Lima, where Mr. Trump said a third of the work force is made up of veterans, the denunciations drew no cheers. And they once again resulted in rare criticism from Mr. Trump’s own party.On Wednesday, Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, called out the president’s string of recent comments about Mr. McCain.“It’s deplorable what he said,” Mr. Isakson said in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting’s “Political Rewind” radio show, adding, “It will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again, and I will continue to speak out.”He joined Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who had criticized the president on Tuesday. “I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,” Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter.Other Republicans, like Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, however, were more muted in responding to Mr. Trump’s latest attacks, choosing to emphasize their support for Mr. McCain rather than confront the president.But at least one Democratic presidential candidate used the moment to demand change in the White House.“This Vietnam vet was brought to tears when hearing the stories of the President going after John McCain this week, as well as the lack of focus on mental health for kids in this country,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote on Twitter, with a picture of her embracing a veteran.Mr. McCain’s family, meanwhile, responded in his stead.“This is a new bizarre low,” Mr. McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, said on “The View” on Wednesday. “I will say attacking someone who isn’t here is a bizarre low. My dad’s not here, but I’m sure as hell here.”She added: “I think if I had told my dad, ‘Seven months after you’re dead, you’re going to be dominating the news and all over Twitter,’ he would think it’s hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death as well.”Mr. McCain’s widow, Cindy McCain, for her part, shared on Twitter a hateful message she received after Mr. Trump’s most recent attacks, in which the sender wished that Ms. McCain’s daughter “chokes to death.”Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s closest political adviser and a harsh critic of the president, said all of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks against critics were of a piece.“The problem isn’t Trump’s disrespect to John and his family — it’s Trump,” he said. “He’s unfit for the office, and most members of Congress know he is. I hope this latest evidence of that convinces more people that he can’t be ignored.”Maggie Haberman reported from Lima, and Annie Karni and Michael Tackett from Washington.AdvertisementSupported byWe could learn a thing or two from the ancient Greeks’ understanding of suffering. By Haider WarraichDr. Warraich is a cardiologist.The United States uses a third of the world’s opioids but a fifth of Americans still say they suffer from chronic pain. The only demonstrable effect of two decades of widespread prescription of opioids has been catastrophic harm. With more than 47,000 Americans dying of opioid overdoses in 2017 and hundreds of thousands more addicted to them, it was recently reported that, for the first time, Americans were more likely to die of opioids than of car accidents.This has forced many to take a step back and ponder the very nature of pain, to understand how best to alleviate it.The ancient Greeks considered pain a passion — an emotion rather than a sensation like touch or smell. During the Dark Ages in Europe, pain was seen as a punishment for sins, a spiritual and emotional experience alleviated through prayers rather than prescriptions.In the 19th century, the secularization of Western society led to the secularization of pain. It was no longer a passion to be endured but a sensation to be quashed.The concept of pain as a purely physical phenomenon reached its zenith in the 1990s, when medical organizations such as the American Pain Society and the Department of Veterans Affairs succeeded in having pain designated a “fifth vital sign,” alongside blood pressure, temperature and breathing and heart rate. This coincided with the release of long-acting opioids like OxyContin. Doctors believed they now had an effective remedy for their patients’ suffering.While opioids do help many patients with acute pain from injuries, surgeries or conditions like cancer, looking back it’s clear that using opioids to treat chronic pain — backaches, bum knees and the like — might well be considered the worst medical mistake of our era.Decades of research suggests that opiates provide little to no benefit for chronic noncancer pain. One recent randomized trial of people with chronic joint and back pain showed that patients using opioids experienced slightly more pain compared with those using medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen.Why is this? Studies have shown that opioids can reduce patients’ pain thresholds. They can also result in a condition called opioid-induced hyperalgesia, in which people feel more and more pain as they are prescribed higher and higher doses of opioids.The conventional thinking about pain as purely a physical stimulus has clearly failed us. Maybe the ancient Greeks knew something we don’t.While the expression that suffering is “all in your head” is too often used to diminish others’ agony, the mind does play a pivotal role in the experience of pain. After a pain signal reaches the brain, it undergoes significant reprocessing. How much something hurts can vary depending on factors like your expectations, your mood and how distracted you are. Just seeing someone else in pain can make you feel worse, too. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in studies of both rodents and humans. In other words, pain is contagious and transmittable. There is also an incredibly strong association between pain and mental health. Conditions like depression and anxiety greatly increase the chance of developing chronic pain, while patients who experience pain are at high risk of developing depression or anxiety. This vicious cycle is partly a result of the fact that there is considerable overlap in the areas of the brain that deal with pain and emotion.Additional clues about the fuzzy line between sensation and perception come from pain’s creepy bedfellow: itching.The sensation of itchiness, which is perceived by some of the same skin receptors that are on the lookout for pain, may seem like a purely physical phenomenon, but it’s not. Just seeing someone else scratch, or thinking about feeling ticklish, can make you itchy, too. Like pain, it can be alleviated through distraction. And like pain, it is closely linked to mental health issues such as depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. All this is not to say that there is no physical component to these feelings. Objectively, there is no doubt that illnesses and injuries can cause immense suffering. The question is how severe that suffering is, and how long it lasts. Recent research shows that pain sensitivity varies significantly among people, most likely as a result of genetic differences. There is so much that we still don’t understand about the fundamental biology of pain, and that needs to change.In the meantime, there is plenty we can do to address America’s pain epidemic. For too long the pharmaceutical industry has blurred our vision. It was just revealed in court filings that drug companies greatly underplayed the risks of opioids, while billions of dollars in marketing told people that pills were the only answer to their ailments.There is a pressing need to increase funding for research into strategies that don’t just involve taking more drugs. Not every person who experiences acute pain goes on to develop chronic pain. We need to learn more about which interventions work to prevent this transformation. Pain management should continue to be emphasized in medical education, but future doctors should be taught that pain is part of the story of the person who suffers from it, not just a separate physical phenomenon. And this education should incorporate ways to avoid prescribing opioids for chronic use. Progress is already underway, as opioid prescription rates have been dropping since 2012 in the United States. But we still have a long way to go: The amount of opioids prescribed per person remains three times higher than it was 20 years ago.Perhaps the most important tool physicians need to manage pain is empathy.If chronic pain is an emotion as well as a sensation, then it is unlikely to be managed successfully without compassion. A 2017 study of doctors in Spain found that those whose patients rated them as empathetic were more effective at relieving their patients’ pain. Physical therapy that doesn’t just manipulate joints but also addresses the context pain comes alive in, encourages optimism and builds emotional resilience has been found to be more effective.All this takes more time and attention than just prescribing a pill, and unfortunately our health system encourages doctors to see as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. We need to change how physicians are paid in order to give them the time to really talk with patients about their pain.Back in medical school, I dislocated a disk in my back. In a snap, pain became my constant companion: It was the last thing I felt before I slept, the first feeling I had when I woke up. Unable to leave my dorm, I fell into a dark hole. I looked fine on the outside but was moth-eaten on the inside. I was adamant that I would avoid painkillers, especially opioids. I had no idea about the science that would emerge over the next few years. I felt that the pain was my body’s way of telling me that something was wrong, and I didn’t want to silence that voice with a temporary fix. What pulled me out after almost a year of agony was not just rigorous physical therapy that molded my spine back into shape but also the kindness of my friends, my family and my future wife. When I see a patient with chronic pain, I try to see that person through the eyes of my younger self. When someone experiences chronic pain, there is no way to quantify it — no blood test to draw, no imaging test to order. It requires physicians to practice medicine the way it was long before the discovery of morphine. In essence, it represents the purest of medical encounters, and an opportunity, if not to cure, then to heal.Haider Warraich (@haiderwarraich), a fellow in advanced heart failure and transplantation at Duke University Medical Center, is the author of the forthcoming “State of the Heart: Exploring the History, Science, and Future of Cardiac Disease.”AdvertisementSupported byReporter’s NotebookWould we fix our prisons if we could see what happens inside them?By Shaila DewanThe contraband is scary enough: Homemade knives with grips whittled to fit particular hands. Homemade machetes. And homemade armor, with books and magazines for padding.Then there is the blood: In puddles. In toilets. Scrawled on the wall in desperate messages. Bloody scalps, bloody footprints, blood streaming down a cheek like tears.And the dead: a man kneeling like a supplicant, hands bound behind his back with white fabric strips and black laces. Another, hanging from a twisted sheet in the dark, virtually naked, illuminated by a flashlight beam.These were ugly scenes from inside an American prison, apparently taken as official documentation of violence and rule violations.Prisons are the black boxes of our society. With their vast complexes and razor wire barriers, everyone knows where they are, but few know what goes on inside. Prisoner communication is sharply curtailed — it is monitored, censored and costly. Visitation rules are strict. Office inspections are often announced in advance.So when prisoners go on hunger strikes or work strikes, or engage in deadly riots, the public rarely understands exactly why. How could they? Many people harbor a vague belief that whatever treatment prisoners get, they surely must deserve. It is a view perpetuated by a lack of detail.But some weeks ago, The New York Times received more than 2,000 photographs that evidence suggests were taken inside the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Alabama. Some show inmates as they are being treated in a cramped, cluttered examination room. Others are clinical: frontal portraits, close-ups of wounds.[The Department of Justice found a “flagrant disregard” for Alabama prisoners’ right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.]It is hard to imagine a cache of images less suitable for publication — they are full of nudity, indignity and gore. It is also hard to imagine photographs that cry out more insistently to be seen.As I scrolled through them, shock rose from my gut to my sternum. Was I looking at a prison, or a 19th-century battlefield? Those pictured betrayed little emotion and certainly none of the bravado broadcast by their tattoos: South Side Hot Boy, Something Serious, $elfmade. After considering the inmates’ privacy, audience sensibilities and our inability to provide more context for the specific incidents depicted, The Times determined that few of these photos could be published. But they could be described.St. Clair is known to be a deeply troubled institution in a state with an overcrowded, understaffed, antiquated prison system. Alabama has one of the country’s highest incarceration rates and, as measured by the most recent counts of homicides available, its deadliest prisons, according to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit civil rights organization in Montgomery. Suicide is epidemic as well — there have been 15 in the past 15 months. For years there have been complaints that St. Clair inmates are heavily armed — some for self-protection — and allowed to move freely about the compound. In fact, St. Clair is more deadly now than it was in 2014, when the Equal Justice Initiative brought suit against it for failing to protect prisoners. There have been four stabbing deaths there in seven months.Last June, the group said the prison was failing to comply with a settlement agreement.Prison officials dispute that, saying the Alabama Department of Corrections is committed to improving safety and security. The department has requested money to raise salaries and increase the number of officers. Multiple law enforcement agencies recently teamed up to conduct a contraband search at St. Clair that recovered 167 makeshift weapons, said Bob Horton, a department spokesman. But as of October, the prison was still severely short staffed, with more vacancies than actual officers. A second lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy group in Montgomery, says the prisons have failed to provide adequate mental health care. (The photos show a message painted on the wall in blood, with letters about the height of a cinder block. “I ask everyone for help,” it read in part. “Mental Health won’t help.”)The photos were given to The Times by the S.P.L.C., which said it had received them on a thumb drive. Bob Horton, a spokesman for the corrections department, said the department could not authenticate the photos. But Maria Morris, a staff lawyer at the S.P.L.C., said the environment shown looked like St. Clair, and some photos had identifying information that corresponded to known inmates or showed men that the S.P.L.C. recognized as its clients (S.P.L.C. removed the identifying information before giving the images to The Times).The man who painted the blood on the wall, referred to in the lawsuit as M.P., had schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and repeatedly tried to kill himself. He testified that he had been held in solitary confinement for six years, allowed to exercise one hour a day in ankle shackles.Ms. Morris has specialized in prisoner’s rights litigation for more than a decade. She hears accounts of rape, beating or stabbing on a daily basis. I asked what it was like for her to see the photographs. They made it impossible, she explained, to retreat into that small, self-protective corner of her mind — the place where it was possible to imagine that her clients’ stories might not be as bad as they sounded. “Seeing what had been done to those people’s bodies — it just stripped away all of the numbing,” she said. “It was very painful to see that all of the suffering that I’ve been hearing about and trying to relate to the court — how deep it goes.”The thumb drive included a document titled “READ ME FIRST” and claiming to be from a corrections officer. It said the photos represented only a “small portion of the injuries from inmate-on-inmate violence in the past three years.”The writer said that the current legal agreements governing the prison stood no chance of working: “The day-to-day treatment of these men does nothing but foster anger and despair. Until major fundamental changes take place in our sentencing and housing of these men it will only continue to get worse. I can’t help but wonder if the public knows just how bad these men are treated day after day and year after year.”The photos show dozens of wounded men. One had been stabbed at least 10 times. Another had a hole in his lip you could stick a pencil through. A pair of handcuffed wrists displayed 15 precise slashes. There was a recurring palette of pale red and sickly, Mercurochrome yellow. One man’s back had a shiv at least an inch wide still buried in it, right between the shoulder blades.There were three individuals pictured in a folder called “Dead men” and seven in a folder called “Murders,” all of whom could be identified through news reports, press releases and booking photographs. But most disturbing were the images that seemed to echo the most painful aspects of African-American history. Many convincing arguments have been made that our penal system was at least partly designed to extend control of black people and their labor, particularly in the South, where after slavery ended black men were conscripted into chain gangs for offenses like vagrancy and “selling cotton after sunset.”Amid the St. Clair pictures were 19 taken of a black man who was completely naked but for a pair of handcuffs, photographed from the front, back, left and right. In one frame two white officers, standing guard inches away from him, avert their eyes.Another image brought to mind the photos of the monstrously disfigured face of Emmett Till, the teenage victim of a 1955 lynching in Mississippi, which galvanized the civil rights movement when they were published by Jet magazine.Though separated by more than half a century and by a wide gulf in circumstances, the St. Clair photos showed another mutilated, African-American face, this time belonging to Emory Cook, a 54-year-old prisoner killed in a cell three years ago. Under Alabama’s harsh version of a three-strikes law, Mr. Cook had been serving a life sentence for third-degree burglary. As a prisoner, he was entitled to be protected from harm. He looked like he had been hit with a plank. AdvertisementSupported byThe active ingredients of ketamine, a popular club drug, show promise in battling deep despair.By Benedict CareyIn a move that may clear the way for the first new treatment in years for depression, an expert panel recommended on Tuesday that federal regulators approve a nasal spray that delivers the active ingredients of ketamine, a popular club drug in the 1980s and 1990s.The new drug, called Esketamine and developed by Johnson & Johnson, is aimed at people with severe depression, particularly those with suicidal thinking. The panel, with 17 voting members, including psychiatrists and consumer representatives, was nearly unanimous in deciding that the drug’s benefits outweighed its risks. The Food and Drug Administration typically follows the recommendations of its expert panels.In recent years, scores of clinics have opened around the country, offering to administer intravenous ketamine for depression, on a schedule similar to that of electroshock therapy: as a series of treatments, over a period of days or weeks, and sometimes including follow-up or “booster” visits months later. These treatments, at an average cost of $3,000, are officially “off-label,” and usually are not covered by insurance. Their effectiveness is not well studied, although people who have received the course of treatment have reported rapid, if not always lasting, relief.If approved, Esketamine would be covered by most insurers.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The interest in ketamine as a potential treatment dates back to 2006, when researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health, led by Dr. Carlos A. Zarate, reported that 18 people who received the drugs intravenously reported that their despair lifted within hours. The drugs currently on the market for depression typically take two weeks or more to provide any noticeable relief, if they do so at all.The discovery of ketamine’s effects on depression was serendipitous; the underlying biology of the disorder remains unknown. Some researchers have since turned away from investigating serotonin — the brain transmitter on which most popular antidepressants work — to instead study the effect of ketamine on brain chemistry, to see if the drug provides any clues to the biology of depression. The federal agency has until March 4 to decide whether to approve the drug. Brook Johnson, 38, a piano teacher in Westminster, Md., has been waiting on approval for months. Ms. Johnson, who is married and has a 9-year-old daughter, doesn’t know if Esketamine will help her, but said that existing antidepressants have failed. She said she had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals six times and has attempted suicide twice.“It was back and forth, and then I’d relapse and they’d put me back in,” Ms. Johnson said in an interview last month. “None of the medicines ever seemed to work. At best, they would either numb me out completely, and you just feel nothing and you can’t think.”“I need alternative treatment as soon as possible,” she said.Paul Manafort’s Trail of ScandalsMy Dead Dad’s Porno TapesTen Meter TowerBetween Sound and SilenceCoal Miner to Trump: “Coal Mining Isn’t Coming Back”House Tour | Cary LeibowitzSanctuary City HotlineAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Officials at a Missouri nonprofit organization accused of bribing Arkansas lawmakers also illegally used the charity's money to funnel campaign contributions to Missouri politicians, according to a federal indictment.Three former Republican Missouri lawmakers confirmed Friday to The Associated Press that they had participated in fundraisers and received campaign donations from people affiliated with the Springfield-based nonprofit Alternative Opportunities Inc., a provider of mental health and substance abuse services that has since merged with Preferred Family Healthcare Inc.But former state Sen. Ryan Silvey, former state Sen. Bob Dixon and former state Rep. Ward Franz each said they didn't know the nonprofit's resources may have been used for the political fundraising, as alleged in the federal indictment released Thursday.None of the Missouri lawmakers are accused of wrongdoing in the indictment, which targets former nonprofit executives Tom and Bontiea Goss and former Arkansas state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, who is the nephew of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. The Gosses and Hutchinson have pleaded not guilty. The indictment is the latest in a long-running investigation involving the U.S. attorney's office in southern Missouri that already has resulted in several guilty pleas and convictions of former nonprofit officials and Arkansas lawmakers. The details of the nonprofit's involvement in Missouri politics are included in the indictment's list of acts constituting an alleged conspiracy.Federal law prohibits charitable organizations such as Alternative Opportunities from making contributions to or participating in political campaigns for candidates.The indictment alleges that between 2013 and 2015, Alternative Opportunities illegally funneled $40,000 in contributions to the campaign of "Missouri Senator A" by passing the money through the Cranford Coalition, a lobbying firm affiliated with former charity executive Rusty Cranford. It also alleges that the charity paid for catering and other expenses for a Feb. 16, 2012, fundraiser for the same state senator.The dates and dollar amounts mentioned in the indictment are similar to those listed in Silvey's campaign finance reports.Silvey told the AP that Tom Goss is his cousin and confirmed that Goss had helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for Silvey's political campaigns over the years.But "I did not know that charity funds were being funneled to me," Silvey said. "Tom and Bontiea Goss did host a fundraiser for me, but I had no idea they were diverting charitable funds to do it. That's not something that I would have signed off on."Silvey, who now is chairman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, said Goss never asked him to do anything in exchange for the contributions. Silvey declined to comment about whether officials from the FBI or U.S. attorney's office had spoken with him as part of the investigation.The indictment also alleges that Alternative Opportunities paid the expenses for a fundraising reception held for "Missouri Senator B" on Sept. 7, 2010. Campaign finance reports indicate that Dixon received donations from Goss and Alternative Opportunities executive Marilyn Nolan around that same time.Dixon, who now is the Greene County presiding commissioner, confirmed to the AP that officials from Alternative Opportunities hosted a political fundraiser for his previous Senate campaign.But "I would be very surprised to learn that they were using charity funds," Dixon said. He added: "They always seemed to be very upstanding people, and I never had any inclination that there was a quid pro quo of any kind."Dixon said he has not spoken with federal authorities as part of the investigation involving Alternative Opportunities.The indictment also said that the charity's board of directors held a meeting on March 15, 2012, in conjunction with a fundraiser for "Missouri Representative A, who was then a candidate for the Missouri State Senate." Campaign finance reports show that Franz, who was running for the state Senate, received contributions from Bontiea Goss and Nolan around that same time.Franz confirmed to the AP that Alternative Opportunities officials hosted a fundraiser for him and that he had served on the nonprofit's board of directors. An Alternative Opportunities filing with the Missouri secretary of state's office in March 2014 lists Franz as a board member, with an "Franzforsenate" email address.AdvertisementSupported byBy Concepción de LeónThe governor of Puerto Rico signed an executive order on Wednesday banning so-called conversion therapy for gay or transgender minors on the island.The decision came after Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives refused to vote on a bill that would have prohibited conversion therapy, a discredited practice that proponents claim can change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The measure passed the Senate this month.“I firmly believe that the idea that there are people in our society who need treatment because of their gender identity or whom they love is not only absurd, it is harmful to so many children and young adults who deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,” Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló said in a statement last week announcing his plans.The original bill, introduced by Senators Eduardo Bhatia and Zoé Laboy Alvarado last spring, sought to ban conversion therapy among licensed medical professionals and in religious institutions that receive state funding.The House refused to vote on the bill or hold public hearings for survivors of conversion therapy. The House speaker, Gabriel Rodríguez Aguiló, said in an interview this week that there was little evidence the practice was widely used in Puerto Rico. Members of the House also felt that the definition of conversion therapy was “too broad” and could potentially include other types of rehabilitation therapy, such as for drug addiction, he said.Mr. Rodríguez Aguiló insisted the decision had “nothing to do” with discrimination against the L.G.B.T. community. “This is purely about a legislation that lacks information, that doesn’t have statistics, and we want to act based on the information that can be offered,” he said.Ms. Laboy Alvarado said the House’s decision was “erroneous, wrong, and causes harm to our youth.”She added, “The reality is that even if only one young person was put through it, that’s enough because of the harm that we’re causing them and our responsibility to protect minors.”Alejandro Santiago Calderón, an activist who said he was forced to undergo conversion therapy in Puerto Rico, interpreted the House’s actions as an attempt to silence gay rights activists.“The L.G.B.T. community is tired, ignored, feels invalidated,” he said.Mr. Santiago Calderón works with a number of organizations, including the transgender task force of Coordinadora Paz Para Las Mujeres, a women’s rights organization. He grew up in an evangelical Christian household, but he left the church because officials continually tried to help him “rid himself of the ‘demon of homosexuality’,” he said.“In Puerto Rico, there is no space where I can practice my spirituality,” Mr. Santiago Calderón said. Almost 90 percent of the country identifies as either Catholic or Protestant, according to a 2014 Pew Center study.The executive order requires all institutions seeking a license to practice medicine to certify that they will not offer conversion therapy, according to a news release from Governor Rosselló’s office.The push to ban so-called gay conversion therapy has accelerated across the United States in recent years. The practice has been banned in 15 states and in Washington so far. The Colorado Senate this week passed a bill to prohibit the practice as well, and Gov. Jared Polis has said he will sign it.Conversion therapy, which is based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder that can be treated or cured, has been widely condemned by rights groups and discredited by mental health professionals for the “serious potential harm” it can cause, according to a report issued by the American Psychological Association and 12 other organizations.“Today we take a step forward to raise awareness among the people about this type of practice that causes pain and suffering,” Governor Rosselló said Wednesday.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a Puerto Rican activist. He is Alejandro Santiago Calderón, not Santos Calderón.AdvertisementSupported byFilm ClubBy Natalie ProulxNote to teachers: Please preview the entire film before sharing it with students to make sure it is appropriate for your class.

Sign up here for the weekly Australia Letter.TOWNSVILLE, Australia — On the 12th day of rain, Ross and Kate Bennett were among the only residents on their street, where the water had risen so high that at one point, Ms. Bennett couldn’t walk into her yard, lest she be swept underwater. After the record-breaking rains subsided, they looked around: The furniture was soggy. The car was soggy. The dogs, Cuddles and Murphy, were soggy.In street after street across Townsville, a coastal city in Australia’s far north, the same story played out in the aftermath of what the authorities called a catastrophe of “unprecedented” rainfall, which brought flooding, crocodiles into the streets, sewage bubbling up out of toilets and, in one week, more water than the city normally receives in a year. Over the course of the floods, two people died, 1,000 people were evacuated, 18,000 residents lost power and at least $74 million in insurance claims have been filed. Yet during and immediately after the disaster, many residents rallied to help one another in ways that mental health experts said were critical for people’s ability to recover from disasters and cope with future ones.And the Bennetts, surveying the damage, were in good spirits. That day alone, they said, they had fielded around 40 calls from people eager to help them clean up their home, some of whom they barely knew. Others wanted to thank Mr. Bennett, who had spent the past few days helping to evacuate his neighbors by boat, even as his own house was going underwater.They were not alone: During the storm, a single family sheltered 60 people and a hairdresser opened her salon to provide drinks and a place for people to dry their clothes. Locals said a blind man and his girlfriend delivered water to residents, to use in place of what the floods had contaminated.Other residents, returning home to the destruction — mildew creeping onto furniture, random objects strewn across their yards, food rotting in their refrigerators — were helped by neighbors as they began the arduous task of putting their lives together again.Community support is the biggest predictor of how well people recover from disasters, “over and above the horrors of the trauma,” said David Forbes, the director of the Phoenix Australia Center for Posttraumatic Mental Health. “Social connections,” he said, are crucial.As climate change makes it likely that disasters will become more intense and frequent, researchers are studying how communities respond, and what they need to be resilient. Being part of a community response can be “protective,” said Brett McDermott, a psychiatrist and professor at the Queensland University of Technology who has helped recovery efforts after several natural disasters, including Cyclone Debbie, which hit Queensland in 2017.“People who get through this are stronger,” he said.[Read more: U.S. Midwest Freezes, Australia Burns: This Is the Age of Weather Extremes.]Helen Peatling, a 77-year-old resident, has had such support, even though the Townsville flood recalled an earlier trauma: In 1950, Ms. Peatling lost her own mother in a flood, and the knock on the door from the police to evacuate “brought it all back,” she said. But on Wednesday, Ms. Peatling said, she “had a really good cry,” and by Thursday, the group of friends she dances swing with six nights a week were helping clean up her home. “I’ve only known Helen for a few months,” said Rod Hardacre, a friend in her dance group. Now, he was helping to sweep the silt into her yard, and stripping her sodden carpet with a bread knife.Not everyone has been so lucky. At the evacuation center at Heatley Secondary College on Thursday, many residents were still unable to return home, and had not yet been placed in other short-term accommodation. Some lay on stretcher beds, while others sat huddled in groups. Colin Strange, another resident staying at the center because he was unable to return home, said he felt like his mind was “going funny.” Chaplain Kennith, 80, sat outside with his dog, a chocolate brown mutt named Coconut.Mr. Kennith said he and his dog had been at the school since being evacuated by the police a week earlier, when eight inches of water inundated his house. The authorities had not found housing suitable for them both, and Mr. Kennith said he would rather sleep on the street than be apart from his dog. All he wanted, he said, was to “go back home.”Danny Tunsin, who had come to Australia on a refugee visa from Thailand, said he had no family in Townsville except for his wife. For people like this with fewer social connections, experts say, psychological first aid — which helps people learn how to cope with disasters and meet basic needs — is crucial. Dale Preston, the regional coordinator for the Australian Red Cross, said that for the most vulnerable, like the homeless and older people, the practical and psychological challenges of recovering from a disaster can quickly multiply. Providing support as soon as possible is important to recovery in the long run, she said. Samantha Klintworth, a general manager at Uniting Care Queensland and Lifeline, a crisis support service, said that social workers tried to replicate those social connections for people who did not have them by offering support services, and encouraging people to share their stories of coping with other disasters. “In this instance, we have community members who were impacted by drought and are now impacted by flood,” she said. “We ask them, ‘Tell us how you coped during the drought.’” But even for those who appear to be coping, said Ms. Klintworth, the real danger zone is six to 12 months after a disaster strikes. It is then, experts agree, when the news coverage fades and others seem to move on, that residents who are still struggling with practical issues, like insurance claims, and emotional trauma, can feel abandoned.Sweeping mud from her porch, Mr. Bennett’s neighbor, Betsy Parker, said she recognized this was possible. The ground floor of her home was destroyed, and she and her husband had moved in with their daughter. “I think the thing that might hit us is down the track, when I’m getting under my daughter’s skin,” Ms. Parker said.On the other hand, she noted, the family was not alone in its struggle. “There’s so many of us in the same bizarre situation,” she said. “After this is all over, we’re going to have a street party.”Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

SlotnikPedro Morales, a Hall of Fame professional wrestler who in the 1970s and ’80s became the first to win all three of what were then wrestling’s premier championships, died on Monday in Perth Amboy, N.J. He was 76.His wife, Karen Morales, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease.Morales, who wrestled professionally for nearly three decades, became a star in the early 1970s. He was known as a vigorous puncher and a master of the Boston crab, a debilitating hold in which he grabbed his opponent’s legs, turned him facedown to the mat and pulled the legs back toward his opponent’s head.Morales tangled with wrestlers like Mr. Fuji, Bruno Sammartino and Ivan Koloff, whom he beat in Madison Square Garden to win the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) title in 1971.Fans were enthusiastic about the new champion.“The biggest problem is not how or if he will win, but how he will get past his adoring fans to his dressing room after the victory,” The New York Times wrote in 1972.Morales held the title for 1,027 days, one of the longest reigns ever, before losing it to Stan Stasiak in 1973.In 1980 Morales and Bob Backlund defeated the Wild Samoans at Shea Stadium to win the World Tag Team title. He won the Intercontinental Championship a few months later by defeating Ken Patera.Morales retired in 1987 and for a time was a Spanish-language commentator for WWE and World Championship Wrestling. He was inducted into what is now the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995.The Hall of Fame wrestler Gorilla Monsoon said in a video for Morales’s induction that wrestlers remembered him as much for his kindness outside the ring as for his ferocity in it.“Pedro Morales, probably one of the greatest-loved World Wrestling Federation champions of all time, because Pedro was genuinely a nice guy,” Monsoon said. “Both inside — well, inside the ring at times he could be a handful. But outside the ring he was Mr. Politeness, Mr. Etiquette.”Pedro Morales was born on Culebra, a tiny island to the east of the main island of Puerto Rico, on Oct. 22, 1942, to Pedro and Theodora (Rivera) Morales. His mother owned a restaurant on Vieques, a neighboring island, and later a bakery on Culebra, and his father worked as a mental health aide in New York and sent money back home.Morales moved to Brooklyn as a teenager and completed high school in East New York. He first wrestled professionally in 1959 and became a regional champion on the West Coast during the 1960s.In one of his best-remembered matches, Morales faced Sammartino, who was often his ally, in front of more than 20,000 people at Shea Stadium in 1972. A curfew ordinance forced the marathon 75-minute match to end in a draw.He met Karen Johnson after a match in 1965, and they married in 1972. In addition to his wife, with whom he lived in Woodbridge, N.J., he is survived by a sister, Aida Morales.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year Morales won the World Wide Wrestling Federation championship. It was 1971, not 1970.Follow Daniel E. Slotnik on Twitter: @dslotnikAdvertisementSupported byBy Jennifer SteinhauerWASHINGTON — Corey Foster spent her Army career caring for wounded troops, both as a flight medic in the Iraq war and at Walter Reed hospital, so she looked forward to one of the most celebrated benefits of military service — health care for life from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Then she walked through the door at a V.A. medical center in Temple, Tex.“You felt like you were a piece of meat,” said Ms. Foster, 34, who retired as a sergeant. “Standing in line at the registration desk, I was getting comments from the male patients behind me, looking me up and down. It was a major source of discomfort.”The treatment was the same at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Murfreesboro, Tenn., where Ms. Foster moved after living in Texas. At that point she gave up, and opted for her husband’s insurance outside the department. “They need to make the facilities not feel like an old soldier’s home,” Ms. Foster said.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]An entrenched, sexist culture at many veterans hospitals is driving away female veterans and lags far behind the gains women have made in the military in recent years, veterans and lawmakers of both parties say. Although the Department of Veterans Affairs has scrambled to adjust to the rising population of female veterans and has made progress — including hiring more women’s health care providers, fixing basic privacy problems in the exam rooms and expanding service to women in rural areas — sexual harassment at department facilities remains a major problem.Women say it is galling that such a demeaning atmosphere persists, especially for the roughly 30 percent of female veterans who have reported being harassed or assaulted while serving in the military. That number includes Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, who spoke at a congressional hearing last week about being raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force.“Changing the culture has been an ongoing, overarching goal,” said Dr. Patricia Hayes, the chief consultant for Women’s Health Services at the veterans agency. “We want women veterans to feel respected and safe and secure.”At a recent hearing with veterans agency officials on Capitol Hill, Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas, described the treatment of female constituents trying to obtain V.A. health care. “It’s like a construction site,” he said.Mr. Carter cited the same medical center in Texas that Ms. Foster had used — and noted that the Women’s Trauma Recovery Center within it was moved last year to a female-only facility in Waco so that women, who said they feared for their safety, could receive treatment without facing harassment.Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas, was visibly frustrated as he described women abandoning the center in his district because of harassment. “This is the biggest concern I hear from female veterans,’’ he said.While the number of women using veteran health services has tripled since 2000 — to about 500,000 from 159,810 — they still make up only 8 percent of all users of health care at the V.A. Officials expect that the number will increase. Two million women are in the American veteran population, or about 10 percent, and yet they make up 16 percent of the active-duty military force.“I believe that we still have a tsunami wave of women vets coming in,” said Dr. Hayes, of Veterans Affairs.For now, many female veterans say they are made to feel as if they do not belong at the V.A., as they describe front-desk employees asking for a husband’s Social Security number when they check in or being passed over for items like complimentary coffee, which employees say are “for vets.”“It’s hard to walk into a place and feel like everyone is looking at you wondering why you are there,” said Kristen Rouse, 45, founding director of the NYC Veterans Alliance, who described a sense of loss every time she glanced at the department’s motto affixed to her center in New York City: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.” Her organization supports changing the motto.“Over the 24 years I have served my country, I have never been any of those,” said Ms. Rouse, who remains a reservist in the Army. “And I never will be.” (That portion of the motto, coined by President Lincoln, is now the subject of legislation.)Some centers, like the one in Washington, have removed benches from entryways so that men no longer have a place to linger and badger women, or have created separate facilities, like the one in Texas. Every center now has at least two providers focused on women’s health and nearly 6,000 providers have been trained in the practice; about 98 percent of them are women.While the V.A. is still trying to address the needs of pregnant veterans — the centers do not provide full obstetrics care on site — many of the centers across the country now have baby showers around Mother’s Day, offering diapers and other baby supplies.Yet the culture remains an impediment for many.Brandy Baxter, who served as a senior airman in the Air Force, loves the care she receives at the women’s health clinic through the Veterans Affairs center in Dallas. But she hates the elevator ride to get there.“The male vets give me the once over with their eyes,” she said. “I look them right in the eye, just to tell them, ‘I’m checking your height, your weight, your skin color — just in case I need to report you.’ ”This year, the House Veterans Affairs Committee will establish a task force to address women’s health care, and harassment issues are expected to be front and center. “This is about the physical transformation of our facilities,” said Representative Mark Takano, Democrat of California and the new chairman of the committee.A model for what women’s health care can be is on display at the Jesse Brown V.A. Medical Center in Chicago, where the vast majority of doctors and staff members are women. The five exam rooms and waiting area are only for women, and beyond offering basic health care, the center offers women a number of programs like a golf team, a weight loss group and art therapy.“I think women veterans really want programming that speaks to their entire identity,” said Jenny Sitzer, the coordinator for women at the center.Staff members wear badges that read, “My name is not ‘Hey baby,’” and banners all over the campus feature the faces of female veterans describing the pain of being harassed on their way through the broader V.A.Lori Brown, 58, is grateful for all these services, but most of all for the ability to walk into the medical center without facing harassment, and to have only women for her care. “I can allow myself to be who I am in front of the doctor or nurse and not be intimidated by men,” said Ms. Brown, who was an Army sergeant.Many other challenges face the V.A., like a shortage of providers for specialty services. Some women say they still struggle to get all of their birth control needs fulfilled at some facilities, and complex laws governing certain fertility treatments remain another area of complaint.Many women do not use the medical facilities because they lack child care, which the department is largely not legally able to provide. Another issue is reaching homeless female veterans, a serious problem that also affects the male population.Women also have mental health care needs — over 40 percent of female veterans who use the V.A. are diagnosed with at least one mental health condition, compared with about 25 percent of men.AdvertisementSupported bysquare feetOur photographers set out to explore three cities that are seeking to restore their connection to nature by reclaiming land for green space. Text by Gregory SchmidtFrederick Law Olmsted understood nature’s ability to rejuvenate the mind and body. One of the principal designers of Central Park in New York, he took pains to replicate the gentle beauty he saw in European parks that blended trees and shrubs, streams and bridges. “The park throughout is a single work of art,” he wrote. That pastoral artistry can be fleeting in a large metropolis. The relationship between humans and nature improves mental health and promotes prosocial behavior. But as cities grow, green space is squeezed out. Community leaders are finding ways to restore some of the balance. The opening of the High Line in Manhattan in 2009 brought national attention to the idea of reclaiming underused space for parks. Its success led to the development of a network of projects across the country, including an elevated park in Philadelphia, a deck spanning a freeway in Dallas and a multiuse trail around downtown Atlanta. An elevated viaduct a quarter-mile long, the first section of the Rail Park in Philadelphia offers a peek of what’s planned. The project will eventually transform three miles of rail lines used by the now-defunct Reading Railroad. Visitors can relax on large wooden platforms and bench swings. The pathway meanders through an area once home to shuttered factories; eventually, it will connect 10 neighborhoods in the city. The Rail Park is part of the High Line Network, a collaborative group of 19 reclamation projects across North America that was announced in 2017 after the success of the High Line. Project organizers share information to help communities transform obsolete infrastructure into public parks. Klyde Warren Park opened in downtown Dallas in October 2012 as a deck over a recessed portion of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway, and it has drawn more than six million visitors since. The park has created more than $2 billion in economic development, according to the foundation that runs it, and has increased property values in the area. The foundation recently announced a $76 million expansion that will add 1.2 acres and include a 20,000-square-foot pavilion with a visitor center. Designed by Jim Burnett, the 5.2-acre park features free daily activities like yoga, live music and a “standing” tour of the surrounding skyline. Popular areas include a children’s park with water jets and interactive fountains, the Imagination Playground, and a reading and games room. Conceived as a master’s thesis by a student at Georgia Tech, the Atlanta BeltLine has expanded into a program of sustainable transportation, land use and green space. The project will redevelop the rail corridor that encircles the city and is expected be completed in 2030. AdvertisementSupported byBy Stephen CastleHEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England — Martin Bradford played guitar at a local venue for the better part of a decade, but he avoids the place now because performing there would mean working with its sound engineer.And that would not end well.Sipping a pint in a riverside pub, Mr. Bradford recalls how he casually mentioned his vote to leave the European Union and instantly lost a friend.“‘You’ve taken my retirement away,’” Mr. Bradford was told, the reasoning being that the sound engineer hoped to move to another European Union country, a right that Brexit could threaten.“Once that conversation had happened there was no going back,” said Mr. Bradford, who also avoids members of his old band after some posted comments on social media that, he said, “painted the people who voted leave as racists, bigots, evil, stupid.”Like the election of President Trump, the 2016 Brexit referendum vote crystallized divisions between cities and towns, young and old, the beneficiaries of globalization and those left behind.And far from fading, the Brexit divide seems to have become entrenched within many British workplaces, families and social circles.The basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.Friendships lost or relationships broken by Brexit have been bemoaned by politicians, featured in newspaper advice columns and spawned novels and at least one play.According to one survey, more than a third of those who wish to remain in the European Union would be upset if a close relative married a strong leave supporter, suggesting that Brexit has morphed into a clash of values.In the aftermath of the referendum, Relate, a counseling service, said that a fifth of the 300 relationship support practitioners surveyed had worked with clients who argued over Brexit. And analysts say Britons are increasingly likely to define themselves in relation to Brexit, rather than allegiance to a party, a dividing line noticed by psychotherapists too.“It’s a bit like 16th-century France between the Catholics and the Protestants,” said Brett Kahr, senior clinical research fellow in psychotherapy and mental health at the Center for Child Mental Health, adding: “I think there is a great deal of hatred of one position toward the other, and a lack of willingness to engage.“It doesn’t make sense to begin to doubt your position if you are so certain your position is the correct one,” Mr. Kahr said.Of course, many Britons have tuned out, bored by endless and incomprehensible Brexit twists in Parliament. Talk of a religious war sounds overblown to Giles Fraser, rector of St. Mary’s church in Newington, South London, but he accepts that “people are talking past each other in a way that perhaps believers, and nonbelievers, might talk past each other.”“It’s definitely visceral, it’s definitely nasty, and there are certainly people who won’t accept the core of the other person’s position,” added Mr. Fraser, who thinks that his support for Brexit in London, which generally voted the other way, cost him friends.If it is hard being a pro-Brexit clergyman in London, it is no easier being a remain supporter in Meden Vale, a former mining village in Nottinghamshire, 150 miles north of the capital, where most people voted leave.But not Chris Hawkins. “I can’t honestly think of anyone from Meden Vale among my group of friends or people I know who voted remain, apart from myself,” said Mr. Hawkins, who works with children with educational problems.After arguments about Brexit, Mr. Hawkins sees less of his two best friends, who now tend to socialize or take bike rides without him. With his parents there has been tension though the major conflict was with one of his partner’s relatives. The discussion was “not very good,” he said with understatement. “He erupted.”“We’ve not been invited to family birthday parties or get-togethers post referendum, whereas before we were,” said Mr. Hawkins who thinks that, here, remainers are seen as being removed from the real world. “I did get a lot of, ‘You went to university,’ after the vote,” he added.Some experts worry that, rather than open feuding, a chilly silence has descended across parts of a population that is often adept at avoiding confrontations.“Brexit is ever-present in the consulting room,” said Sarah Niblock, chief executive of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy. “It is now so excruciating, and so difficult for people to have conversations about Brexit — families, workplaces neighbors are so split — there is so much of a division between groups in society that it is almost as if the therapeutic room has become the last place people can talk with any ease.”Those trying to make sense of it all include Candida Yates, professor of culture and communication at Bournemouth University, who is researching Brexit sentiment.Her idea was to get the two groups in the same room but, when that proved impossible she initially met them separately.“They were very, very emotional,” said Ms. Yates. “It was a very powerful experience: people coming together who didn’t know each other, there were tears — and these were all with people who voted the same way.”For the remainers it was rather like a bereavement group. “There was this huge sense of loss. People talked about waking up on the day of the vote crying and in shock and they didn’t fully understand it themselves. They understood that they were upset but why did they feel so strongly? So it was a bit like a therapy group.”For leavers there was more a sense of grievance than grief, Ms. Yates said, and a feeling “that they had been left behind, they had been forgotten, it was really this town-city divide.”Winning the referendum was an unexpected victory — some described it as a gift — but a precarious one.“They couldn’t quite believe their luck and also said — even back then in 2016 — ‘It will be taken away,’ ” Ms. Yates said. “They were saying, ‘They won’t let us have it.’ There was a real feeling of ‘them and us’ and a feeling of powerlessness. They had managed to get this, but how long they could hang on to it, they didn’t know,” she added.More recently, Ms. Yates managed to cajole two groups into the same room. “People talked about it being like a civil war,” she said. Indeed, some mentioned Britain’s Civil War, which took place in the 17th century, or even episodes further back in history.“They talked about the Civil War, they talked about the Norman yoke, people have gone back and back. It’s as if these earlier schisms had been reawoken.”She noted tension within families, a fact that chimes with Samantha Raaphorst, a part-time language student who cares for two autistic children in Leeds, and who struggles to communicate with the family of her elder son’s father, from whom she separated some years ago.When Brexit featured on the news during a visit, she said, “They asked me how I voted, and I said I voted remain, and suddenly the atmosphere of the room completely changed.”“They didn’t understand my point of view at all,” Ms. Raaphorst said. “They said, ‘Why wouldn’t you want this country to be great again? Why wouldn’t you want us to start trading with other global powers? Why wouldn’t you want us to be Great Britain?’ And they started talking about empire. I was absolutely stunned.”“I wrote them a letter saying I was quite upset about what happened,” Ms. Raaphorst said. “They sent my son a letter saying that they just want to protect him from people coming in and out of the country that might hurt him.”For Andrew Parnall, a software trainer who lives in Derby, Brexit has also caused family tension, in his case with his niece, a leave supporter. “We don’t talk much now, it has poisoned the well,” he said.Mr. Parnall recalls crying on the morning of the referendum result and says he feels emotional still.AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistBy Kwame Anthony AppiahI have an 8-year-old great-grandchild. I would like to help her develop a sense of charity. If I were to give her $40 per year to donate, how should I present the options to her, without overwhelming her? Were I to show her images of starving Yemeni children, homeless Americans, threatened wildlife, Syrian/Central American refugees and so on, I fear she wouldn’t be able to process such a burden of information. How can an 8-year-old confront the neediness of our world in an age-appropriate way? Are there baby steps to charitable giving? I want my great-granddaughter to develop a sense of obligation. Name WithheldThe duty of charity is what Kant called an imperfect duty. That is, it’s not a duty to help anyone in any particular way. He thought you should sometimes help those in need, but no particular others and in no particular way. The Islamic duty of charity, or zakat, is binding on all Muslims who are rich enough: They must pay some small percentage of their wealth annually. But it, too, is imperfect in the sense that you do not have to pay it to any particular person in need. In both cases, it’s a duty you may fulfill in a variety of ways. You’re not expected to give to everyone who asks, or even to everyone who has needs. And it’s also limited, in a sensible way, by your ability to give.Commendably, you want your great-​granddaughter to be someone who will contribute to helping those in need. Should we call it a sense of obligation? This might suggest that what matters is doing good out of a sober sense of duty. Instead, I favor what I take to be Aristotle’s view — that if we develop the right feelings, we will take pleasure in exercising the virtues. In other words, you’ll want your great-granddaughter not just to think that she should give to those in need but to develop and enjoy the habit of doing it. And asking her to choose among assisting those in very dire situations far away — refugees, the homeless, disappearing species — might not be the best way to do that.Maybe, too, the giving of money isn’t the best place to start, because it might not help her sense the effects of her contributions. Later in life, she might find herself drawn to the sort of carefully tested “effective altruism” that my colleague Peter Singer has advocated. But for now, why not find opportunities for her to help others more directly, such as in one of the many charities that work in your local community?If there’s a soup kitchen, for example, maybe you and she could make something to contribute. Your plan was to have her research charities elsewhere. How about beginning your research locally? In time, you’ll want her to develop a sense of the connectedness of the world and an interest in supporting philanthropy in other places, especially those where the needs are most substantial. But for a child, the old maxim may be right: Charity begins at home.I have been living abroad for the past five years, and my mother is planning her first visit. My father has expressed interest in joining. (They are still together but live separately and spend limited time together.)My father has a history of mental health issues that makes spending time with him, particularly in settings outside the home, almost unbearable. My sibling recently went on a trip with him and was forced to cut it short because of his behavior. He can be very aggressive and quick to anger, particularly when he is outside his comfort zone. My mother and he fight constantly in a way that gives me severe anxiety. I believe he will ruin the trip for my mother and me. On the other hand, he is my father, and I love him. I know how hurt he would be if I asked him not to come. Given his history of depression and suicide attempts, I fear that excluding him would be incredibly taxing on his mental health. (He also refuses help and therapy.)My parents have left it to me to decide if I want him to join. Do I owe him an invitation because I fear for his safety, or do I owe it to my mother to ask him not to come, when I am almost certain he will ruin the trip? Name WithheldObviously, you’d feel terrible if your father harmed himself as a result of your not inviting him. But that’s the core problem here: Your father has untreated psychological problems and won’t do anything about them. It might be that, were he to accept treatment, he’d be able to join you without ruining the holiday. You report his refusal of help as a given. Maybe you could take this occasion to urge him once more to get help, precisely so that you can have him along. That’ll allow him to see that you care for him but need him to change. Otherwise, it might be a better plan to invite him on a separate visit. Your mother has to deal with his psychological difficulties often enough already. I’d give her a holiday you can both enjoy.I discovered that two of my co-workers are having an emotional and sexual affair with each other. During that time, one co-worker began divorce proceedings; the other married someone else. I am very close friends with one of these co-workers. When I confronted my friend about the affair, she stated that she knew it was wrong and intended to break it off. Since then, this co-worker has regularly confided in me about the relationship. She has admitted that she is in love with the other co-worker but knows they have no future together. They are still sleeping together. I have met the other co-worker’s spouse, and I know they intend to start a family. Do I have a duty to tell the spouse about the affair, or is it none of my business? If I do speak up, could I do so anonymously? Name WithheldMost of what you know about this relationship is a result of information confided in you by your friend and co-worker. You can’t pass it on without first discussing the matter with your friend. Absent your friend’s consent — or a clear and present danger of harm to the lover’s spouse — you have a duty not to tell anyone. Even if your friend did give her assent, her motives for doing so would be, at best, conflicted. And you’d still have to decide whether it was any of your business. That someone might benefit from knowing something does not impose a duty of disclosure on anyone who happens to find it out. And other people’s sex lives are usually not our business.I work at a company with a toxic culture, and we are planning to hire a senior leader who will be moving across the country to take the position. I very much respect this person personally and professionally, so I would like your opinion about how honest I have to be about the culture before the person accepts the role, which is very likely. On one hand, someone who is senior should understand the necessity of conducting due diligence, but on the other hand, I fear that not saying something would cause this person to view me as having been disingenuous during the interview process, and could burn a professional bridge. One complicating factor is that I believe in our product. I also want the company to be successful because I have a potentially valuable early-stage equity stake. (I plan to quit within the next three or four months because I no longer wish to be associated with the culture.) This senior leader would be a great replacement for me. Name WithheldWhen Mrs. Gradgrind is on her deathbed in Dickens’s “Hard Times,” she’s not sure that she’s in pain; she just knows that there’s a pain “somewhere in the room.” That’s how you speak about your company’s “toxic culture” — as if it’s a hovering vapor, not a set of specific activities by specific people. Maybe your defeatism is well grounded; maybe it’s part of the problem.Now then: You mention two conflicting interests here, the company’s chances of doing well, which will protect the value of your equity, and your relationship with this potential senior co-worker. (If you thought you or the potential senior leader could improve the toxic culture, I assume you’d have mentioned it.) You apparently want this person to come because you think he or she would improve the company’s prospects, especially if you yourself departed.AdvertisementSupported byBy George Gene GustinesIn Issue No. 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp, which arrives in comic stores on Wednesday, the title hero comes to a realization: “I need help. I think I’m bipolar … and I don’t think I can handle this alone.”The comic book series, from Marvel Entertainment, stars Nadia Van Dyne, who received her scientific curiosity and size-changing abilities from her father, Henry Pym, a.k.a. Hank, the former Ant-Man. The issue is written by Jeremy Whitley, drawn by Gurihiru and lettered by Joe Caramagna.Last month, the teenage Wasp was shown intensely trying to solve one problem, which then multiplied into a huge problem. The chalkboard she used for her plans is a cacophony of ideas. The situation seems familiar to Nadia’s mentor, Janet Van Dyne (the original Wasp and the ex-wife of Hank Pym). “This looks a lot like a manic episode,” she says, while telling Nadia’s friends that Hank had bipolar disorder. “If it’s not treated, a person can have episodes — intense changes in mood — especially in times of stress,” she explains.Nadia’s having bipolar disorder is something Whitley discussed with his editor, Alanna Smith, early on. In doing his research, Whitley said in a telephone interview, he learned that bipolar disorder can be passed along genetically. “I thought it made sense that she would most likely deal with it at some point,” he added.In the January issue, Nadia was shown running on fumes, refusing to sleep or eat until her work was done. She also lashed out against her friends.The confrontation continues in the new issue as Nadia retreats into her miniature laboratory. In that subatomic environment, where time moves more quickly, Nadia goes into a depressive phase. One of her friends follows her, and the two have a powerful moment (better experienced than spoiled here).Whitley said he heard from family members of people with bipolar disorder who recognized the manic behavior in the previous issue. They “could see what was happening before anyone said anything,” he said.His goal, he said, was to make sure the condition was treated respectfully, and he consulted with psychologists on the subject. He said he “also wanted to reflect the reality of the situation: Bipolar disorder is not something you can cure,” though medicine and therapy can help. He hopes that coping with the disorder remains an important part of the Wasp’s character, but not her entire being: “For real people, there’s so much more to their lives and personalities than this one thing.”In Issue No. 5, the regular Q. and A. feature is with Chris Ceary, who teaches psychology at Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute. Ceary discusses comics, mental health and the presentation of Nadia’s bipolar disorder. “I know so many people will feel seen by this depiction, and that is a gift,” she says.Whitley was also proud that it is one of Nadia’s friends who helps her. “It was important to me to have this character who is not a superhero, who does not have any sort of exceptional powers, to save the day because she has the life experience to help Nadia,” he said. “There are a lot of stories out there of people who have made it through things because they had the right person at the right time.”An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the artist of the cover of Issue No. 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp.

In an interview a few hours after he announced his candidacy, Mr. Ryan said he wanted to address the “economic disorientation” caused by the decline of traditional manufacturing.Mr. Ryan said he had decided to enter the race in part because of the recent closing of the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which is in his district. In places like Ohio and Michigan, where the auto industry was long the cornerstone of the economy, he said he envisioned jobs in electric vehicle construction and other renewable energy industries.With its focus on electric vehicles and renewable energy, Mr. Ryan’s economic agenda ties in neatly with combating climate change. He said his policies would go well beyond that but has not yet outlined how.He said on Thursday that he would recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement, which President Trump has vowed to abandon, but added that it was “not anywhere close to what we need to do.”And while he supports the restoration of Obama-era regulations that Mr. Trump is reversing, he added that he wanted to pursue consensus policies that would not be reversed or defunded if partisan control shifted. But it is far from clear what such policies would look like in a political reality in which many elected Republicans have denied the established science of climate change.Mr. Ryan is generally aligned with the Democratic Party’s progressive wing on health care. He is a co-sponsor of Representative Pramila Jayapal’s “Medicare for all” bill, though he has argued in the past against the term “single-payer” health care because he doesn’t believe most Americans understand what it means.On Thursday, he criticized the United States’ current health system as being “focused on disease” at the expense of preventive care.

Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed at a colorful and uplifting Grammy Awards on Sunday, defying expectations that the event would be drab. The stars also all but steered clear of any political messages.The host, Alicia Keys, set the positive tone by telling personal stories and speaking often of peace and love. And she lead the event with an all-star moment of female solidarity, which included a surprise appearance by Michelle Obama, who said that music “has always helped me tell my story,” and “allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in.”[Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.]Obama wasn’t the only unexpected attendee with a message of empowerment. Drake, one of the most nominated artists this year, with seven nods and one win, showed up to accept the award for best rap song for his smash “God’s Plan.”Drake, who has skipped the Grammys in recent years and turned down an offer to perform at this year’s show, used his time on stage to speak to other artists and to children who aspire to music fame. His message: That awards like the Grammys are not a measure of success in the music industry.“We’re playing in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, explaining that music is a business where powerful people who don’t necessarily understand artists’ experiences are often making the decisions.“The point is you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown, if — look, look — if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you that, you already won,” he said, holding up his Grammy.Not long after, Diana Ross, in a flowing red gown, celebrated her upcoming 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career: “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).”She punctuated her performance by speaking to the crowd. “So much love in this room,” she said. “Together we have no limits. There’s only success ahead and you can lead the way. Learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.”Earlier in the night, Lady Gaga accepted an award for “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” and said she was proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues. “A lot of artists deal with that, and we’ve got to take care of each other,” she said, adding, “So if you see somebody that hurting, don’t look away.”And Dua Lipa, winner for best new artist, clapped back at Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy, who said last year that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers.“I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said, accepting her award, referring to the strong showing by women this year.“For anyone that hasn’t realized how special they are to have a different story, a different background, a name that honors their roots because they just want to be normal, whatever the hell that means,” she went on, adding, “never let that get in the way of you and your dreams, because you deserve it.”AdvertisementSupported byVoicesA good novel can be a reminder that other people have endured tragedies, long ordeals, bad odds.By Maura KellyOne humid night in September, I called a mental health crisis center. I told the volunteer who answered that when I looked into my future, I saw nothing good. I felt so overwhelmingly alone in the world I was terrified. The despair that had been haunting me for so long would, I feared, eventually kill me. What could I do?The volunteer suggested that I take a warm bath.Interesting. It was still nearly 80 degrees at 7 o’clock in September. I was sweating in a stuffy old house in upstate New York, and I wanted a warm bath about as much as I wanted to walk over a bed of fiery coals.My silence prompted the volunteer to try again: “Could you put on the kettle for some herbal tea?”Through my teeth, I snarled, “I don’t want tea.”The volunteer’s advice seemed ludicrously inadequate to my situation. I had told her that the anniversary of my father’s suicide was approaching; that he’d never recovered from my mother’s death when I was small; that his torment, tormenting me, had always been a weight around my neck. I’d explained that the sleeping problems and debilitating fatigue of my depression had been crippling me for nearly 20 years, making life a relentless ordeal. I barely wanted to live with myself; how would anyone else ever want to live with me — or love me?I’d lost hope that I’d find a lasting relationship or be able to have a child. I’d lost hope in general.The volunteer tried again. “O.K. Then how about, do you have something good to read?”I lifted my head to consider that idea.A good book — usually, that did help. A good novel is great company, less an escape from life than a different way to engage. A good novel is reassurance that other people have endured tragedies, long ordeals, bad odds. It’s evidence I’m not alone — not in the history of humanity, at least. A good novel often ends on an ambiguous note — yet every novel also implies a survivor still alive to tell the tale. A good novel is a form of hope.But although I was deep into an exceptionally good novel, a masterpiece, in fact, I’d been compelled to put it down a few days earlier. The book was “Anna Karenina,” famously about a suicide. I’d been about 700 pages in when the titular character’s despair picked up speed, just as my own mood deteriorated. Fearing Anna’s darkening thoughts would darken my own, I’d stopped reading.Even so, after I hung up the phone, I sat down next to “Anna Karenina” on my couch and wondered if it was really a danger to me. Suicidal Anna hadn’t been whispering directly into my ear as I read. She hadn’t been convincing me as she convinced herself. Rather, an omniscient narrator of brilliant psychological insight was telling me all sides of Anna’s story — giving me access not only to Anna’s mind, but to the minds of the people around her. In that way, the narrator created a more rounded picture of Anna’s world than I would have had if I’d heard only from her.I’d read past the point where Anna had walked away from everything — her stiff husband, her position in society, even her beloved young son — to move in with her lover, Count Vronsky. Anna’s brother and sister-in-law remain loyal to her, but her old friends shun her as a “fallen” woman. She becomes increasingly isolated. In her psychological confinement, she can’t help taunting herself with the idea that Vronsky has grown tired of her and now loves someone else.Though I had no husband or lover, I understood how Anna felt; I felt that the world had grown tired of me. But I could also follow Tolstoy as he took me into Vronsky’s mind, where I saw that Vronsky was a man of real if unconventional principle; the count remains committed to Anna, respectful of all she’s given up for him, and determined to care for her — even as her jealousy strains his love.Maybe reading on wouldn’t hurt.So I poured myself a glass of ice water and picked up “Anna Karenina” again.I turned the pages and found Anna collapsing under the weight of her anxiety. She sends a messenger to Vronsky with an urgent request, Come at once. Vronsky never gets her note. But Anna doesn’t realize that. She takes his nonresponse as proof their love is dead. Feeling that all is lost, she heads for a railway station. I knew Anna would kill herself by kneeling before a train, so I urged her to stop and turn around: You poor fool! Look at all you have. Look at all the people you’ll hurt.In saying that to her, I said something similar to myself: I’m not utterly alone. I have a devoted sister and a choir of supportive friends; even a “fairy godmother,” the exquisitely compassionate mother of one of my closest friends who often talks me through my dark spells. I have more options than other people with major depression who are homeless, addicted or imprisoned. I still have plenty of life left.In other words, Tolstoy wasn’t riling up in me a voice that mirrored Anna’s. Rather, he was rallying me, calling on me to talk back to Anna, and to the Anna in myself.Of course, nothing I said would change the mind of a fictional character. Anna descends to the tracks. In her final seconds, she has an overwhelming insight: “Suddenly the darkness that covered everything for her broke and life rose up before her momentarily with all its bright past joys. … She was horrified at what she was doing.” Horrified — but too late. The locomotive is on her. Her life is over — and in destroying herself, she also lays waste to Vronsky with the guilt and grief she leaves behind.AdvertisementSupported byBy Benjamin Weiser[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]New York City has agreed to pay $3.3 million to settle a lawsuit on behalf of the estate of Kalief Browder, the young Bronx man whose detention on Rikers Island became a symbol of the breakdown in criminal justice in New York and fueled the drive to ban solitary confinement for youths in the city’s jails.Mr. Browder, who was 16 years old when he was arrested in 2010 and accused of stealing a backpack, was detained on Rikers Island for three years — about two of which were spent in solitary confinement — without being tried or convicted of a crime. In 2015, at age 22, he hanged himself at his parents’ home in the Bronx.The settlement, which is cited in a court document, was confirmed by the city and the family’s lawyer.In a statement, the city’s Law Department said, “Kalief Browder’s story helped inspire numerous reforms to the justice system to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again, including an end to punitive segregation for young people on Rikers Island.“We hope that this settlement and our continuing reforms help bring some measure of closure to the Browder family,” the statement added.The civil rights and wrongful death action is before a judge in State Supreme Court in the Bronx.The family’s lawyer, Sanford A. Rubenstein, said papers would soon be submitted to the judge “to finalize the resolution of this matter.”“It’s a fair settlement, given the tragedy of what happened here,” Mr. Rubenstein said. “While no money can ever bring Kalief Browder back, we hope the settlement of this case and the changes that took place at Rikers will result in this not happening to any other victims.”Mr. Browder’s case was first chronicled in a 2014 article in The New Yorker, which described how he was beaten by correction officers, and endured repeated delays in the clogged Bronx court.Mr. Browder also turned down offers to plead guilty, including one that would have allowed for his immediate release, as he insisted on his innocence, the article said. Bronx prosecutors ultimately dropped the case against Mr. Browder, who was released in 2013.In December 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had ended the use of solitary confinement for 16- and 17-year-olds. After Mr. Browder’s death the following June, Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that “Kalief’s story helped inspire our efforts” at Rikers Island.“There is no reason he should have gone through this ordeal,” Mr. de Blasio said, “and his tragic death is a reminder that we must continue to work each day to provide the mental health services so many New Yorkers need.”The de Blasio administration also developed a plan to move Rikers inmates under 18 to a dedicated jail for youths in the Bronx.In 2016, President Barack Obama wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post announcing a ban on solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. In it, Mr. Obama cited Mr. Browder’s “constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day” and his suicide.Susan Beachy contributed reportingFollow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter: @BenWeiserNYTAdvertisementSupported byBy Gabe CohnSyfy’s risqué magic show returns for a fourth season.

They represent perhaps the greatest unmet need in psychiatry. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a prescription treatment intended to help them, a fast-acting drug derived from an old and widely used anesthetic, ketamine. The move heralds a shift from the Prozac era of antidepressant drugs. The newly approved treatment, called esketamine, is a nasal spray developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a branch of Johnson & Johnson, that will be marketed under the name Spravato. It contains an active portion of the ketamine molecule, whose antidepressant properties are not well understood yet. “Thank goodness we now have something with a different mechanism of action than previous antidepressants,” said Dr. Erick Turner, a former F.D.A. reviewer and an associate professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University. “But I’m skeptical of the hype, because in this world it’s like Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown: Each time we get our hopes up, the football gets pulled away.”The generic anesthetic is already increasingly available for depression, at hundreds of clinics around the country that provide a course of intravenous treatments, and studies suggest it can help treatment-resistant people. It often causes out-of-body and hallucinogenic sensations when administered; in the 1980s and 1990s it was popular as a club drug, Special K. The cost for these treatments typically is out of pocket, as the generic anesthetic is not approved by the F.D.A. for depression. In contrast, esketamine likely would be covered under many insurance plans, and its side effects, though similar to those of generic ketamine, are thought to be less dramatic. The recommended course of the newly approved drug is twice a week, for four weeks, with boosters as needed, along with  one of the commonly used oral antidepressants. F.D.A. approval requires that doses be taken in a doctor’s office or clinic, with patients monitored for at least two hours, and their experience entered in a registry; patients should not drive on the day of treatment. Esketamine, like ketamine, has the potential for abuse, and both drugs can induce psychotic episodes in people who are at high risk for them. The safety monitoring will require doctors to find space for treated patients, which could present a logistical challenge, some psychiatrists said. The cost for a one-month course of treatment will be between $4,720 and $6,785, said Janssen, and experts said it will give the company a foothold in the $12 billion global antidepressant market, where most drugs now are generic. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The approval of esketamine marks a new approach to treating serious mood problems, experts said. Prozac and similar drugs enhance the activity of brain messengers such as serotonin; they are mildly effective, but they take weeks or months for their effects to be felt, and for many patients they provide little or no relief from depression. In contrast, the ketamine-based compounds — several others are being developed — work within hours or days, and are effective in some people who are considered “treatment resistant,” meaning they have not benefited from other antidepressants.“These are exciting times, for sure,” said Dr. Todd Gould, an associate professor of psychiatry in the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “We have drugs that work rapidly to treat a very severe illness.” Dr. Gould was not involved in the Janssen study but has identified a metabolite, or ketamine breakdown product, that could be developed into another drug. Experts with long experience in treating depression were encouraged by the news, but also chary. The effectiveness of the previous class of antidepressants such as Prozac and Paxil was vastly exaggerated when they came on the market. And the results of esketamine trials, which were paid for and carried out by Janssen, were mixed.In each trial submitted, all patients were started on a new antidepressant drug, and given a course of esketamine treatment or a placebo. In one monthlong study, those on esketamine performed better statistically than those on placebo, reducing scores on a standard, 60-point depression scale by 21 points, compared to 17 points for placebo. But in two others trials, the drug did not statistically outperform placebo treatment. Historically, the F.D.A. has required that a drug succeed in two short-term trials before it is approved; the agency loosened its criteria for esketamine, opting instead to study relapse in people who did well on the drug.In that trial, Janssen reported that only about one-quarter of subjects relapsed, compared to 45 percent of subjects who received the placebo spray. All the subjects had been given a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression, or T.R.D., having previously failed multiple courses of drug treatment. “We’ve had nothing new in 30 years,” said Steven Hollon, a professor of psychiatry and behavior sciences at Vanderbilt University. “So if this drug is an effective way to get a more rapid response in people who are treatment resistant, and we can use it safely, then it could be a godsend.”One question that will need to be answered is how well esketamine performs in comparison to intravenous ketamine. Theresa, 57, an adjunct professor of English in New York, who asked that her last name be omitted to protect her privacy, has lived much of her life with deep depression. She tried a course of I.V. generic ketamine last summer, at a local clinic, which  typically entails a half-dozen infusions, given over a couple of weeks, for about $500 apiece, with follow-up “booster” treatments as needed.“I remember floating, I was really high,” she said. “I was tripping on sounds, textures and shapes, that was very much a part of it.” The first infusion provided no relief, she said. But after the third or fourth, she noticed a satisfying “shift” in her underlying mood. “It’s a hard thing to describe. I was still anxious, but I felt somehow more solid, like something gelled within me, and my husband has noticed it, too.”Dr. Glen Brooks, the founder and medical director of NY Ketamine Infusions, a clinic in downtown Manhattan, said he has treated some 2,300 people, of all ages, with intravenous ketamine, the generic anesthetic. His clients had received a variety of diagnoses, including post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as depression.“What they all have in common is that other medications have failed,” Dr. Brooks, an anesthesiologist, said. “They’re hopeless, and they think, ‘Nothing else has worked, why should this?’” He said that, in his experience, the infusions quickly reduced symptoms for teenagers and young adults, but seemed to be less effective for people over 50.The data that Janssen presented to the F.D.A. likewise suggested that esketamine was less effective in people aged 65 and older, barely better than placebo treatment.Ketamine was developed more than five decades ago as a safer alternative to the anesthetic phencyclidine, or PCP, and is used worldwide, in operating rooms, on the battlefield and in pediatric clinics. The World Health Organization has listed ketamine as one of its essential medicines since 1985.By the 1990s, interest turned to the drug’s potential to combat depression, when a government scientist named Phil Skolnick argued that targeting glutamate pathways — the primary “excitatory,” or neuroactivating, brain processes — could produce antidepressant effects. In 2000, a team of researchers at Yale University and the Connecticut Mental Health Center, led by Dr. Robert M. Berman, reported that doses of ketamine provided quick relief to seven people with depression. The field took off in 2006, when a team at the National Institute of Mental Health led by Dr. Carlos Zarate Jr. reported that 18 treatment-resistant people who received the drug intravenously reported that their despair lifted within hours. “What seems remarkable is that the drug also seems to help domains other than depression, like anxiety, suicidal thinking, and anhedonia” — the inability to feel pleasure — said Dr. Zarate, chief of the N.I.M.H.’s experimental therapeutics and pathophysiology branch. “It seems to have more broad effects, on many areas of mood.” The apparent ability of ketamine to blunt suicidal thinking is particularly compelling, and Janssen is pursuing this indication for esketamine. In jails and psychiatry wards, suicide is an acute risk for people in crisis, and a fast-acting drug could save many lives, doctors said. For now, no one knows whether esketamine, or any of the other ketamine-based compounds being studied, are any more effective than the generic anesthetic itself — or, for that matter, whether the out-of-body and hallucinatory “side effects” are in fact integral to its antidepressant properties.“For that, we will need head-to-head studies,” Dr. Zarate said. “And we don’t have those yet.”AdvertisementSupported byFinding out you have a chronic illness — one that will, by definition, never go away — changes things, both for you and those you love.By Tessa MillerSeven Thanksgivings ago, I got sick and I never got better.What I thought was food poisoning turned out to be Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that doesn’t have a cure. It fools my immune system into attacking my digestive system, resulting in what I can only describe as the attempted birth of my intestines through my butthole. It’s a cruel and often debilitating disease.Since that first hospital stay, I’ve had colonoscopies, biopsies, CT scans, X-rays, blood and stool tests, enemas, suppositories, rectal foams, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, antivirals, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, opiates, steroids, immunoglobulin, biologics and three fecal transplants (if you want to hear a story about my 9-year-old poop donor and a blender, find me on Twitter).My disease is managed now thanks to an expensive drug called infliximab, but the future is unpredictable. IBD works in patterns of flares and remissions, and little is known about what causes either.When I was diagnosed, I didn’t know how much my life would change. There’s no conversation about that foggy space between the common cold and terminal cancer, where illness won’t go away but won’t kill you, so none of us know what “chronic illness” means until we’re thrown into being sick forever.“When an illness that the doctors can’t cure becomes part of our life, all the rules seem to change,” said Paul K. Chafetz, Ph.D., a psychologist in Dallas. “It’s scary in a dozen ways.” I’ve learned countless lessons since the early days of my illness, but here are five I wish I’d known from the start.Chronic illness patients not only face painful physical symptoms, but also mental ones that linger even when the disease is well controlled. “There is trauma related to certain aspects of illness or treatment, and fear of outcomes like death or disability,” said Matt Lundquist, LCSW, a psychotherapist in New York. “For many people, there are financial uncertainties of paying for medical care.” Plus, there’s anxiety over loss of autonomy and control, he said.Chronic illness also increases the risk of depression, Mr. Chafetz said, citing a 2007 World Health Organization survey that found a higher likelihood of depressive episodes among those with chronic health conditions than without.A therapist should be considered a crucial part of your care team, just as important as a gastroenterologist or cardiologist. “A provider who has experience working with chronic illness is key,” Mr. Lundquist said. “It’s a population whose mental health struggles can be misunderstood.” If you’re homebound, some mental health professionals will do home visits, Skype or phone appointments, or you can connect with one through apps like TalkSpace and BetterHelp.[Please note, if you’re feeling helpless or suicidal, the Suicide Prevention Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255.

You grieve a version of yourself that doesn’t exist anymore, and a future version that looks different than you’d planned.You might have to give up career goals, hobbies and family plans, learning a “new normal” in their place. “In trauma therapy we call this ‘integration,’ the task of integrating a new reality into one’s life and worldview,” Mr. Lundquist said. “This emotional work can look a lot like grief therapy for a passing loved one.” Try to be patient as you get to know the new version of yourself.“Having a chronic illness is a series of continuous ups and downs where some things that work for a while won’t and so on,” said Alicia Aiello, president of Girls With Guts, an organization that empowers women with IBD and ostomies. “Be open to this change.”People are compelled to offer advice about chronically ill bodies because they’re convinced a fix must exist. Here are a few of the things I’ve been told, unsolicited, to try over the years: yoga, meditation, essential oils, acupuncture, CBD oil, vaping, prayer, bone broth and [fill in the blank with the latest fad] diet. Some of these are great in conjunction with medical treatment — my doctor recommends meditation for stress relief, for example — but the advice is offered as a cure or a better alternative to whatever I’m already doing. And let’s face it, no amount of broth is going to turn off my spazzy immune system.Chronically ill people research their diseases ad nauseam. They try more treatments than they can count. In many cases, great scientific minds can’t crack a cause or cure. So unless someone asks for your advice, don’t offer it. If you’re on the receiving end of misguided advice, say something like, “I appreciate that you’re trying to help, but my doctors and I think this treatment is best right now” or “There’s no known cure for my disease, but I’d love if you donated toward the research to find one!” You can also educate them by saying, “Thank you, but that wouldn’t help. Here’s how my disease works, and here’s the kind of treatment that’s required.”Maybe it’s because I’m a journalist, but when I was diagnosed, I dove into research. Learning as much as I could helped me feel a sense of control, so I bought every available IBD book and spent hours reading studies and forums online. I made lists of questions for my doctors and insisted they give me their personal phone numbers. I expected my friends and family to be as gung-ho as I was, but turns out, most of them never even Googled my disease. It was up to me to learn and teach — friends, family, bosses, partners — through conversations, books with passages marked, emails highlighting new research, and social media posts.There’s a sense of shame that comes with chronic illness that pressures patients into secrecy, making them feel like they can’t discuss their disease outside of the doctor’s office. Secrecy bolsters the lack of public conversation and knowledge, which feeds the shame patients feel. “Let others know what’s going on,” Ms. Aiello said. “People with chronic illnesses withhold information to protect themselves or others, but this can be more hurtful.”Chronic illness is really lonely.Loved ones try their best, but your fellow “spoonies,” as they’re affectionately called, intimately know the challenges of forever sickness. Six in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic condition, and thanks to the internet, it’s easier than ever to connect with them in support groups and chronic illness communities.It took me three years to join an online IBD community. I pridefully thought I could go it alone, but that was like being lost at sea and ignoring a rescue ship. Now, I tell all newly diagnosed folks to join a support group right away — it doesn’t just help you feel less alone, but it connects you with resources and provides a place to ask questions and share stories without shame. The Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation has resources to help you find one. For a sometimes embarrassing “bathroom disease” like IBD, this is especially vital.AdvertisementSupported byBy Daniel E. SlotnikKristoff St. John, who won two Daytime Emmy Awards during his long tenure on the CBS soap opera “The Young and the Restless,” was found dead early Sunday morning at his home in Los Angeles. He was 52.Sarah Ardalani, a public information officer at the Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office, confirmed the death. She said that an autopsy had been conducted but that the cause of death had not been determined.Mr. St. John spoke openly about his depression after his 24-year-old son, Julian, committed suicide in 2014. Mark Geragos, Mr. St. John’s lawyer and friend, said in a telephone interview on Monday that Mr. St. John had told him recently that his grief and depression had worsened.Mr. St. John began playing Neil Winters, a cosmetics executive who struggled with infidelity, alcoholism and many other plot twists, on “The Young and the Restless” in 1991. He most recently appeared as the character in January, completing nearly 1,700 episodes of the show.He told The Toronto Star in 1994 that he saw Winters as “energetic and striving for the top spot,” someone who “doesn’t really see himself as a ladies’ man but rather quite sensual” and “very secure.”Mr. St. John won 10 N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards for playing Winters, one of the longest-running African-American characters on a soap opera.Kristoff St. John was born on July 15, 1966, in New York City and grew up in Bridgeport, Conn., and Los Angeles. His father, Christopher, was a producer, director and actor; his mother, Maria, was an entertainer. Both of them inspired him to enter show business.“My dad is a producer-director,” Mr. St. John told the Canadian newspaper The Edmonton Journal in 2000. “Had he been a fireman, I’d probably be putting out fires.”Mr. St. John began acting as a child. His television career started with an appearance on the sitcom “That’s My Mama” in 1975. He played a young Alex Haley in “Roots: The Next Generations” (1979) and had a recurring part on the television version of “The Bad News Bears,” on which his father also appeared. He was also seen on “Family Matters,” “Martin,” “A Different World,” “Diagnosis Murder” and other shows.Mr. St. John’s two marriages, to the boxer Mia St. John and Allana Nadal, ended in divorce. Last year he became engaged to Kseniya Mikhaleva, a Russian model.Mr. St. John had two daughters, Paris, from his first marriage, and Lola, from his second. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.His son, Julian, an artist who suffered from schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction, died by asphyxiating himself with a plastic bag at a mental health care facility in Long Beach, Calif., in 2014. Mr. St. John and his first wife, Mia, accused the staff of negligence, filing a lawsuit against the facility and airing their grievances in an interview on “Entertainment Tonight.”“My son died because there are millions of people suffering from the mental disabilities of schizophrenia, bipolar and being depressed,” Mr. St. John said. “And so at the end of the day his life will not be in vain. His life will be vindicated, and I will campaign until the day that I die to bring justice to my son.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Jesse McKinley[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]ALBANY — After a measles outbreak in Brooklyn and Rockland County and amid growing concerns about the anti-vaccine movement, a pair of state legislators are proposing allowing minors to receive vaccinations without permission from their parents.The bill would allow any child 14 years or older to be vaccinated and given booster shots for a range of diseases including mumps, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, influenza, hepatitis B and measles, which seemed to be the primary reason for alarm after the recent outbreaks.“We are on the verge of a public health crisis,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat from Albany, citing lower-than-recommended inoculation rates in some communities, spurred by unconfirmed suspicions about vaccines causing autism. “We’ve become complacent over the last couple of decades.”[Your questions on measles and its vaccine, answered.]That sentiment was amplified recently by the World Health Organization, which listed “vaccine hesitancy” as one of the Top 10 global threats. In Rockland County, officials are reporting 145 confirmed cases of measles, with the vast majority of those afflicted aged 18 and under. Of those, four out of five have received no vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella.City health officials have also reported more than 100 cases of measles in Brooklyn, and a single case in Queens as well. As in Rockland County, most of those cases involved members of the Orthodox Jewish communities where vaccination rates typically lag well behind the norm.[One Student Was Not Vaccinated Against Measles. 21 Others Got Sick.]If passed and signed into law, the bill would make New York part of a group of states — ranging from liberal Oregon to conservative South Carolina — that allow minors to ask for vaccinations without parental approval, though some states also require minors to be evaluated to determine if they are mature enough to make such a decision. The New York bill would not require such an evaluation.Even more states, including New York, allow minors to seek out health care services on issues like substance abuse, mental health issues or reproductive health services.The introduction of the bill came just days after dramatic Congressional testimony from an Ohio teenager, Ethan Lindenberger, who defied his mother’s wishes and got vaccinated after he became convinced that she had fallen prey to online conspiracy theories about the dangers of vaccines. Multiple studies have debunked such theories, including a major European report issued last week, which showed that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination does not increase the risk for autism.On Monday, the New York chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics came out in favor of the bill, saying it comported with a longstanding idea known as the “mature minor” exception to parental consent as well as a more recent realization that young people are better at recognizing false online reports.“Young people are often more conscious about the misinformation on the internet and can in many cases disagree with parents who have bought into unfounded and dangerous anti-immunization diatribes and pseudoscience,” said a memo from the organization in support of the bill. “These young people have a right to protect themselves.”Highly contagious, measles can contribute to a range of serious health complications, particularly in children, including pneumonia and swelling of the brain. It can also be fatal in rare cases. The measles vaccine came into use in the 1960s and the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000.Most states allow religious exemptions to vaccination requirements, but some states have pushed back on such exemptions, including California, which barred them in 2015 after a measles outbreak and eroding rates of vaccination. Democratic lawmakers in Albany have also introduced a bill to eliminate religious exemptions, though it is not clear whether it will receive a vote.Nationwide, vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella are still above 90 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the numbers are down incrementally from two decades ago. But as evidenced in Rockland County, some communities are practically uninoculated.State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat who is sponsoring the bill in Albany’s upper chamber, said that the bill would address not only minors put at risk by their parents’ prejudices against vaccines but also those without engaged adults in their lives.“You’re talking about a pretty heavy level of maturity if you’re saying, ‘I want to get vaccinated even though I can’t get any adults in my family to understand why this is important,’” she said.Ms. Fahy said she was “very sensitive to the rights of parents” to oversee their children’s health care but felt that the broader public health concerns were overwhelming.“It’s not just the individual who is at risk when they are not immunized,” she said. “You are putting other people at risk.”AdvertisementSupported byAsk Real EstateMy neighbor’s hygiene issues are affecting my apartment. How do I solve the problem without forcing her out of her home?By Ronda KaysenQ: A rent-stabilized tenant in my co-op building is a hoarder. My apartment is near hers and now, for the first time in 15 years, I have mice and roaches. The board said that the sponsor of the hoarder’s apartment isn’t doing what he should, but if I report the situation to the health department, the building will just get more fines. The mice freak out my wife, the roaches freak me out, and the exterminator says the hoarder is the source of our problems. What can and should we do?A: You and your wife are entitled to live in a sanitary home not overrun with pests. An apartment packed with belongings could pose health and safety hazards for the tenant, the co-op and you. If your neighbor’s hygiene creates a fire hazard or causes foul odors, leaks or vermin infestations, she may be in violation of her lease and could potentially face eviction.Hoarding is a mental disorder, one that often progresses or worsens with time, which might explain why you’re only seeing the mice and roaches now. Because this is a mental-health problem, any solution will include a measure of patience and compassion.“There are city agencies that could be called. There are social services agencies. Sometimes when you employ multiple different remedies at once, all of those things would put pressure on the party to clean up their act,” said Barry G. Margolis, a litigator in the Manhattan office of the law firm Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson. “It’s not a helpless or hopeless situation.”In your case, the co-op board does not have a direct relationship with the hoarder. Instead, the hoarder’s lease is with her landlord, who is a shareholder in the co-op and must comply with the co-op’s rules. The landlord could ultimately take his tenant to housing court if she’s in violation of her lease. But there are less adversarial steps he should take first, like enlisting family members or nonprofit organizations like the Educational Alliance to help.Whatever the course of action, it will only happen if the co-op compels the landlord to do his job. Write letters to the co-op board and the managing agent, providing as much detail as you can about odors and evidence of vermin between the units. The current conditions may violate your warranty of habitability, a state rule. Remind the co-op board of that and urge it to use whatever leverage it has over the landlord to force him to act.As frustrated as you are, calling 311 to report the condition may not get you very far. You’ll antagonize the building, and a violation from the Health Department won’t fix the problem. Instead, contact support agencies like Adult Protective Services, which could appoint a guardian, if it comes to that. If you see any friends or family visiting, ask to speak with them about whether they would be willing to help.AdvertisementSupported byBy Colin MoynihanFederal prosecutors are recommending that Mary Boone, the veteran art dealer, be sent to prison for as much as three years, saying she deliberately defrauded the government by filing false tax returns and evading $3 million in taxes.Ms. Boone, who is to be sentenced on Jan. 18, pleaded guilty last year to two counts of filing false returns, a charge that carries a maximum three-year prison sentence. Her lawyers had asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan to spare her any prison time, writing that her offenses were the product of depression and anxiety brought on by childhood trauma rather than greed.Prosecutors rejected that argument in court papers this week, arguing that Ms. Boone had achieved a measure of financial stability and comfort that “most people can only dream about” and should serve 30 to 37 months in prison.“Boone was the sole architect and beneficiary of this tax fraud scheme and, contrary to her assertions now, engaged in it out of pure greed — to line her own pockets by cheating the system,” the prosecutors wrote.Ms. Boone opened her gallery in SoHo in 1977 and rose to prominence while showing the work of artists like Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. She remained a constant in the ever-changing art world and now operates two gallery locations — one on the Upper East Side and the other in Chelsea.In their court filing, prosecutors described a multipart scheme that Ms. Boone was said to have carried out between 2009 and 2011, using money from her gallery to pay for personal expenses and then claiming them as business deductions. They said the personal expenses included $793,003 used to remodel her Manhattan apartment and about $300,000 in personal credit card charges. Those charges, the prosecutors wrote, included beauty salon purchases of $24,380, nearly $15,000 spent on jewelry, nearly $14,000 on products from Hermès and more than $5,000 on items from Louis Vuitton.As part of her fraud, prosecutors said, Ms. Boone tried to conceal the personal nature of some expenses by listing them as related to business in her handwritten tax ledgers. For example, they said, she identified $600,000 in payments to a contractor remodeling her apartment as a business expense under the categories “commission” and “fee/design.”In addition, prosecutors said, Ms. Boone inflated the gallery’s stated expenses and income to fraudulently generate business losses when, in reality, the business was profitable.Ms. Boone’s lawyers have argued that her troubled childhood led to mental health issues, a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol abuse. The poverty of her early life left her fearful that, despite her success, she would end up destitute and dependent upon others, they wrote, creating “a feeling of inevitable doom” and an “irrational fear that everything would fall apart.”Prosecutors responded that Ms. Boone, in that case, might have been expected to have saved her undeclared, untaxed income instead of spending large amounts on apartment renovations and luxury purchases.“Boone’s conduct clearly demonstrates that she was motivated by greed and a desire to maintain her lavish lifestyle,” they wrote. “Even if it meant breaking the law.”AdvertisementSupported byThe cultural roots of our political problems.By David BrooksOpinion ColumnistFour years ago, in the midst of the Obama presidency, I published a book called “The Road to Character.” American culture seemed to be in decent shape and my focus was on how individuals can deepen their inner lives. This week, in the midst of the Trump presidency, I’ve got another book, “The Second Mountain.” It’s become clear in the interim that things are not in good shape, that our problems are societal. The whole country is going through some sort of spiritual and emotional crisis.College mental health facilities are swamped, suicide rates are spiking, the president’s repulsive behavior is tolerated or even celebrated by tens of millions of Americans. At the root of it all is the following problem: We’ve created a culture based on lies.Here are some of them:Career success is fulfilling. This is the lie we foist on the young. In their tender years we put the most privileged of them inside a college admissions process that puts achievement and status anxiety at the center of their lives. That begins advertising’s lifelong mantra — if you make it, life will be good.Everybody who has actually tasted success can tell you that’s not true. I remember when the editor of my first book called to tell me it had made the best-seller list. It felt like … nothing. It was external to me. The truth is, success spares you from the shame you might experience if you feel yourself a failure, but career success alone does not provide positive peace or fulfillment. If you build your life around it, your ambitions will always race out in front of what you’ve achieved, leaving you anxious and dissatisfied.I can make myself happy. This is the lie of self-sufficiency. This is the lie that happiness is an individual accomplishment. If I can have just one more victory, lose 15 pounds or get better at meditation, then I will be happy.But people looking back on their lives from their deathbeds tell us that happiness is found amid thick and loving relationships. It is found by defeating self-sufficiency for a state of mutual dependence. It is found in the giving and receiving of care.It’s easy to say you live for relationships, but it’s very hard to do. It’s hard to see other people in all their complexity. It’s hard to communicate from your depths, not your shallows. It’s hard to stop performing! No one teaches us these skills.Life is an individual journey. This is the lie books like Dr. Seuss’ “Oh, the Places You’ll Go” tell. In adulthood, each person goes on a personal trip and racks up a bunch of experiences, and whoever has the most experiences wins. This lie encourages people to believe freedom is the absence of restraint. Be unattached. Stay on the move. Keep your options open.In reality, the people who live best tie themselves down. They don’t ask: What cool thing can I do next? They ask: What is my responsibility here? They respond to some problem or get called out of themselves by a deep love. By planting themselves in one neighborhood, one organization or one mission, they earn trust. They have the freedom to make a lasting difference. It’s the chains we choose that set us free.You have to find your own truth. This is the privatization of meaning. It’s not up to the schools to teach a coherent set of moral values, or a society. Everybody chooses his or her own values. Come up with your own answers to life’s ultimate questions! You do you!The problem is that unless your name is Aristotle, you probably can’t do it. Most of us wind up with a few vague moral feelings but no moral clarity or sense of purpose. The reality is that values are created and passed down by strong, self-confident communities and institutions. People absorb their values by submitting to communities and institutions and taking part in the conversations that take place within them. It’s a group process.Rich and successful people are worth more than poorer and less successful people. We pretend we don’t tell this lie, but our whole meritocracy points to it. In fact, the meritocracy contains a skein of lies.The message of the meritocracy is that you are what you accomplish. The false promise of the meritocracy is that you can earn dignity by attaching yourself to prestigious brands. The emotion of the meritocracy is conditional love — that if you perform well, people will love you. The sociology of the meritocracy is that society is organized around a set of inner rings with the high achievers inside and everyone else further out. The anthropology of the meritocracy is that you are not a soul to be saved but a set of skills to be maximized.No wonder it’s so hard to be a young adult today. No wonder our society is fragmenting. We’ve taken the lies of hyper-individualism and we’ve made them the unspoken assumptions that govern how we live.We talk a lot about the political revolution we need. The cultural revolution is more important.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

Upon entering, they find a lounge, complete with couches, a barber chair and books on finance. The spiral staircase leads to an area with workstations. Inside on a recent day, a man who works as a consultant helped five others get businesses certified. Another launched a campaign to run for City Council, engaging members to assist in outreach. An author presented research in a forum. The Gentlemen’s Factory brought them all together.As one of the very few spaces in New York City exclusively for men of color, The Gentlemen’s Factory began as a middle ground between work and home for men who need a venue for networking and socializing. “They’re going through a divorce, or they have mental health challenges, or they’re going on an interview but they don’t know how to ask for a salary increase,” said Jeff Lindor, the club’s founder. “There wasn’t an outlet for them to be.”Mr. Lindor, clad in a custom-made Prince James suit (the designer is a Gentlemen’s Factory member) noted that members contribute to making the space their own, whether it’s the Malcolm X art above the leather sofa or the magazines near the coffee table.Born in Petit-Goâve, Haiti, Mr. Lindor was raised in a Coney Island housing project. The son of non-English speaking immigrants, Mr. Lindor and his family were wedged between a wealthy, white community on one end of the neighborhood and an impoverished and predominantly black population on the other. He asked himself: Why does my community look like this? Why does blackness look like this?The socioeconomic disparities between white and black people inspired Mr. Lindor to study Urban Policy at the New School, where the seed of what would become The Gentlemen’s Factory started to germinate.While earning his master’s degree, he organized gatherings with other black men to discuss their experiences.Their first event was a Saturday gentlemen’s brunch in Brooklyn, with a $50 entry fee. When 40 black men showed up, Lindor realized that the group might need a dedicated physical space. The mixers that followed led to hundreds of black male New Yorkers gathering. “I had to ask myself,” Mr. Lindor said, “Is this an enterprise or a hobby?” At the time, Mr. Lindor was working as the strategic adviser to the executive staff at the Department of Correction, in the DeBlasio Administration. He resigned, spent two months developing a business model, then secured a lease with money he had saved. Mr. Lindor asked friends who made more than six figures a year if they would support him; in the end, they invested $100,000 into The Gentleman’s Factory."There are very few spaces where men of color can come together and engage in meaningful dialogue, said Rubain Dorancy, a member who is also an attorney and an educational consultant. “At the Gentlemen's Factory, you will find men of all ages and with varied backgrounds, engaging, supporting and uplifting each other." Spaces made by and for people of color are not new. In 1826, young African-Americans gathered at 161 Duane Street to socialize and discuss the arts in a group known as the Philomathean Literary Society. In 1892, Victoria Earle Matthews, an author and activist, created the first black women’s club in New York City, the Women’s Loyal Union. Five years later, in 1897, she created the White Rose Mission, in uptown Manhattan, where young black girls who migrated from the South could get acclimated to city life.Yet social spaces for people of color such as The Gentlemen’s Factory — with its 100+ member strong base and a range of event programming, from finance workshops to wellness seminars — remain extremely rare in New York.In the 1950s and ’60s, there were many social clubs in different communities of color, but as the decades passed, their numbers dwindled. Some clubs closed because they were being operated illegally; others could not afford the expensive licenses required.Today, Toñita’s is often called the last Puerto Rican social club in Brooklyn. The last remaining black LGBTQIA+ club in New York City, Langston’s, needs $73,000 to stay open. The Gentlemen’s Factory charges $150 a month for membership. Prospective members must fill out an application and be interviewed and screened by a committee. If a white man wanted to join, Mr. Lindor says, “We don’t discriminate. He’ll just have to know that all of the content is still going to speak about the black and brown male experience.”In New York, the law states that any public establishment must allow full and equal access to people irrespective of race, as well as “color, religion, or national origin.” Alicia McCauley, Deputy Press Secretary of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, says, “NYC Human Rights Law protects against racial discrimination in any form, including in public accommodations such as social clubs. However, social clubs can be centered around certain experiences as long as the membership policy is not discriminatory based on race, religion, national origin, or any one of the other 22 protected categories in NYC.”Mr. Lindor’s dream is to expand into Harlem, DC, and London, and to learn how to navigate venture capital funding. “I was privileged enough to get family and friends to donate, but when I look at my counterparts, they’re getting millions. There need to be more spaces like this — but how are we going to fund it?”Najla Austin, the 27-year-old founder of the forthcoming Ethel’s Club, has no interest in venture capital funding. While working at tech start-ups, Ms. Austin kept her eyes on the women’s co-working space The Wing, which opened in 2016. She considers it to be one of the “coolest, innovative” spaces around — and wondered if there might be a possibility for black and brown people to replicate that success. For two years, she kept her ear to the ground to see if more spaces for people of color would pop up. When they didn’t, she said, “I’ll do it.”Last October, Austin created an Instagram page for Ethel’s Club — a name honoring her grandmother. The following day, 600 people had signed up for the wait list on the accompanying site.“I got tons of emails — people wanting to have an event or buy a membership. Most companies struggle with demand, and for me, it was the opposite.”While Ms. Austin will not disclose the amount of money she’s received in fund-raising, it is enough for her to be looking at 10,000-square feet locations in Brooklyn for a proposed August 2019 opening. There will be a boutique featuring products made by people of color in the front of the club, and a members-only quarter in the back. Membership is application-based; interested parties must support the brand mission of empowering and advancing people of color. With regards to fees, Ms. Austin said, “There is tiered access with the hope of allowing everyone the ability to use the space as needed with a financial commitment they’re comfortable with.” A one-year membership is required, and events will range from matchmaking to wellness to tech workshops. Her credo is “for us by us.” Ms. Austin is not looking for investors whose interests might conflict with those of people of color.Ladin Awad was a student at the New School where she met and befriended Sienna Fekete. A few years later, the duo linked up with June Canedo at a brunch; they then planned conversations about identities, privilege, and the spectrum of experiences for women of color.Each woman is from a different place in the diaspora — Ladin from Sudan, June from Brazil and South Carolina, and Sienna, a Caribbean-Canadian, from Los Angeles. When they researched lexicons, “chroma” stood out for its meaning as an intensification of color. “That makes sense because that’s what we’re amplifying, women of color,” Ms. Fekete said. Although there is no strict ban on white people attending their events, like Mr. Lindor and The Gentlemen’s Factory, the trio emphasizes that people of color are going to be centered and prioritized.Chroma has organized events with names like “Working Women of Color” and “Continuity: A Conference on Self-Preservation for Women of Color.” Its members recently celebrated the grand opening of their studio in the Lower East Side, a goal financially realized through their networks. At the Chroma studio, they partner with other collectives and document the conversations, which have themes such as digital archives, social media and mental health, and alcohol and drug addiction. “We were having a candid transparent conversation of the struggles that we go through as a collective,” Ms. Fekete said. “There is a need for a physical space.”What these spaces share, in addition to catering to people of color, is the privilege of connections. AdvertisementSupported byBy Amy QinHONG KONG — A man attacked and injured 20 children with a hammer on Tuesday at an elementary school in Beijing, the local authorities said.Three children at the Beijing No. 1 Affiliated Elementary School of Xuanwu Normal School in the district of Xicheng were seriously injured in the late-morning attack, the district government said on the social media site Sina Weibo. But none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, it said.A 49-year-old maintenance worker at the school was taken into custody by the police, the government said. The statement identified the man by his surname, Jia, and said he was from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. It said he was believed to have attacked the children because the school would not renew his contract.The man attacked the students between classes with a hammer that he used for repairs, the statement said.A video circulating on a Chinese messaging platform, WeChat, showed what appeared to be the principal of the school addressing a room full of anxious parents. In the video, the principal said the suspect had attacked the children in six different classrooms.Censors quickly removed several initial media reports and posts on Sina Weibo about the attack, allowing only brief official statements and ones carried by the central government’s news outlets.Images posted online showed panicked parents pressed up against the school gates, pleading with officials for more information. In the video circulating on WeChat, an unidentified woman asked parents not to disseminate any information shared by school officials.The authorities’ tight control over information after such attacks reflects a longstanding fear of drawing public criticism over how the government handles threats to public safety. This attack was particularly sensitive because the school is in the heart of the Chinese capital.Mass shootings are a rare occurrence in China, where gun ownership is tightly regulated. In recent years, however, a pattern of violent attacks has emerged involving assailants using knives or other weapons, often targeting children in schools.In April, a man with a knife killed nine children and injured 10 at a middle school in central China. In June, a man wielding a kitchen knife killed two students and injured two other people outside an elementary school in Shanghai.In October, a woman with a knife injured 14 students at a kindergarten in southwestern China. Last month, eight people were killed and more than 20 injured when a man with a knife hijacked a bus and drove it into traffic in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian.Experts have pointed to growing social anger over unemployment and rising inequality to explain such attacks. A lack of support for people with mental health issues and the copycat effect are also seen as possible factors.Classes at the Beijing school appeared to have resumed after the attack, and by late afternoon, parents had gathered to pick up their children as usual. But there was a heightened security presence outside the gates of the school, with at least four police cars parked nearby.“We are worried,” said Guo Yulan, as she waited by the gates for her grandchild, a fourth-grader at the school, to come out. “The school won’t say what’s happening.”Zoe Mou, Elsie Chen and Echo Hui contributed research from Beijing.AdvertisementSupported byNewsbookBy Concepción de LeónThe American Library Association on Monday released its annual list of the “most challenged” books of last year — those that community members tried to get removed from their schools and libraries. It’s an imperfect measure, because the A.L.A. says most book challenges are not reported, but the objections noted for each book reflect some of the cultural issues dividing the United States: Six out of the 11 books were challenged for containing L.G.B.T.Q. characters. Another was challenged for “depicting stereotypes of Mexican culture,” according to the A.L.A. website. Here are the 11 books banned this year.GEORGEBy Alex Gino195 pp. Scholastic.George, about a 10-year-old transgender child who has secretly renamed herself Melissa and longs to play Charlotte in her fourth-grade school play, was on the list of most banned books in 2016 and 2017 as well. When it was published in 2015, our reviewer called it “the most right-now book imaginable.”“How do you talk to children about Caitlyn Jenner? Give them ‘George,’” he wrote.A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARLON BUNDOBy Jill Twiss; illustrated by EG Keller40 pp. Chronicle.This book, the brainchild of the comedian John Oliver, parodies “A Day in the Life of the Vice President,” by Charlotte Pence, Vice President Mike Pence’s daughter. Oliver’s version is about a gay romance between two bunnies, and he said it was meant as a rebuke to the vice president’s opposition to gay and transgender rights.CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS (SERIES)Written and illustrated by Dav PilkeyThe series as a whole was challenged for being perceived as “encouraging disruptive behavior,” and “Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot” was specifically challenged for including a same-sex couple, according to the A.L.A. The book follows two fourth-grade boys, George Beard and Harold Hutchins, and the superhero they invented: Captain Underpants.THE HATE U GIVEBy Angie Thomas444 pp. Balzer & Bray/HarperCollins.Thomas’s novel is about Starr Carter, a 16-year-old girl who is moved to action after she sees a police officer kill her childhood friend Khalil. Our reviewer called it “a page turner brimming with pop culture references and humor,” and it has been on this paper’s best-seller list since it was published in 2017.DRAMAWritten and illustrated by Raina Telgemeier233 pp. Scholastic.In this graphic novel about Callie, a theater-loving teenager determined to create a set worthy of Broadway, Telgemeier “draws up-by-their-book-bags characters who value hard work and seize a chance that has nothing to do with looks or even with love,” our reviewer wrote.THIRTEEN REASONS WHYBy Jay Asher288 pp. Razorbill.This book, which inspired the popular Netflix series by the same name, is made up of transcripts of the tapes recorded by 16-year-old Hannah Baker before she died by suicide. It was challenged for depicting teenage suicide.THIS ONE SUMMER By Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki319 pp. First Second.Our reviewer called this graphic novel a “moving, evocative book.” It follows Rose and Windy on their annual summer trip to a lake house in Awago Beach with Rose’s parents. But this summer is different: The girls are growing up, and they must contend with older boys, Rose’s mother’s mental health challenges and more.SKIPPYJON JONES (SERIES) Written and illustrated by Judy SchachnerUnpaged. Dutton Children’s Books.Our reviewer praised this series about a Siamese cat who thinks he is a Chihuahua, calling it “refreshing because of its irreverence,” but it was challenged for stereotypical depictions of Mexican culture, according to the A.L.A.THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART-TIME INDIANBy Sherman Alexie; illustrated by Ellen Forney230 pp. Little, Brown.This young adult novel follows Arnold Spirit Jr., a geeky Native American living a hard life on the Spokane Reservation. After he gets in trouble in school, a teacher gives him some advice: to get out. He transfers to a new school with more resources and greater opportunities, but he is the only American Indian, and he struggles to fit in there and back home. Our reviewer called this “a gem of a book.”THIS DAY IN JUNEBy Gayle E. Pitman; illustrated by Kristyna Litten40 pp. Magination.In this picture book, Pitman depicts a pride celebration.

But doctors treat them in a variety of ways.By Gina KolataA recent essay in The New England Journal of Medicine was titled “Heart and Sole — Of Metatarsals, Meaning and Medicine.” I had to read it. It’s not often you come across a reflection on metatarsal fractures, though they are common. I had just recovered from breaking my fifth metatarsal, the slender bone on the outside edge of the foot, so I was curious. The author, Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, broke a fifth metatarsal while walking in Central Park. “My ankle rolled out of my shoe,” she wrote. I broke mine running on a debris-strewn path before dawn. I stepped on something — a rock? a branch? — and violently twisted my foot.We both felt an intense, stabbing pain. But there Dr. Rosenbaum’s path and mine diverged.She was told she had a Jones fracture, a famously difficult break. She was handed a boot and crutches. She asked if she could swim, explaining “that my mental health depends on exercise.”No, she was told: “You have a notoriously slow-healing fracture.”When I injured my foot, I phoned an orthopedist, Dr. Justin Greisberg at Columbia University Medical Center, who suggested an X-ray. He called afterward to tell me what I had broken. The fifth metatarsal is a very common fracture, he said, and mine was not very serious. I should use crutches as needed but could do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Exercise? Yes. The elliptical machine? Yes.I knew some things, like running, would be too excruciating to contemplate. But within a week, I had gone from using crutches occasionally to not using them at all. I was exercising on an arc trainer at the gym. A week later, I was back on the elliptical.I had another X-ray a month later. Dr. Greisberg told me I could start running again, as much as was comfortable. So I did. And soon I forgot about the injury altogether.How did Dr. Rosenbaum fare? She hobbled around on crutches and used a scooter, propping up her leg on a seat. After a while, she broke the fifth metatarsal in her uninjured foot, too, because she was constantly putting her weight on it. I asked my doctor about the discrepancies in our treatments. There are a variety of metatarsal fractures, he told me. Most are easy ones, like mine, that don’t require anything except patience. A few rare ones, like the type Dr. Rosenbaum had, need what he called “more cautious care.”And hers, she said in an email, needed that care. “Mine was a real Jones,” she wrote. It took three months, but now it is healed.Thing is, some doctors treat all of these fractures conservatively.“One of the most common second opinions I get in New York City is the fifth metatarsal fracture,” Dr. Greisberg said. “Patients sometimes can’t believe that many of these will heal no matter what they do.”The key is to properly diagnose the fracture, said Dr. Bruce J. Sangeorzan, an orthopedist at the University of Washington in Seattle and past president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. For the unfortunate people who have the rare, difficult to heal fracture, treatment means eight weeks of putting no weight on the foot. Even with that, they may not get better without surgery because the break is in an area that does not get much blood.But an accurate diagnosis can be elusive, said Dr. J. Turner Vosseller, an orthopedist at Columbia University. The difference between a hard-to-heal fracture of the fifth metatarsal, the so-called Jones fracture, and the more common fracture like mine is less than one centimeter.“There can be some confusion as to which is which,” Dr. Vosseller said. Further complicating the issue is that some fractures “straddle the line” between hard and easy to heal, Dr. Vosseller said.One centimeter: That’s the difference between going about your business and letting the fracture heal — and winding up on crutches, maybe in a cast. AdvertisementSupported byBy Iliana MagraLONDON — For two years, inmates at a prison in Wales have been allowed to lock their cells from the inside — for privacy. Guards have been expected to follow a “knock first” policy before entering. The detainees have had access to laptops, through which they can order meals.And please, don’t call them “prisoners.”The unusual accommodations, publicized by the British newspaper The Telegraph and other news outlets this past week, were put in place at Berwyn, the largest prison in England and Wales, which opened in February 2017. The policies are part of a government overhaul of prison practices in England and Wales intended to improve conditions and bolster rehabilitation.Six new jails are planned in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph noted. And despite opposition from some prison workers, the government regards Berwyn as “a model for a modern prison,” according to a continuing study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council seeking “to unlock an age-old question of whether prisons can really rehabilitate offenders.”But the approach has been a failure, an official from a trade union for prison workers said on Sunday.“It’s a social experiment that has been a complete disaster,” the official, Mark Fairhurst, the chairman of the Professional Trades Union for Prison, Correctional and Secure Psychiatric Workers said in a phone interview.“Berwyn has the highest assault rates on officers — they lost control because they were too soft; they listened to psychologists who don’t do our jobs,” he added.Berwyn, about 170 miles northwest of London, has capacity for 2,106 male inmates. The prison follows guidelines set out in a 2017 research project, “Well-Being in Prison Design,” that was funded by the Royal Institute of British Architects in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice.As part of the measures, privacy locks were installed to allow inmates to lock their cells (though they can be overridden by guards); prison officers were required to knock on cell doors before entering; prisoners were provided with laptops that could gain access to an internal network; and different terms were used to refer to the men inside and to their cells.“These physical measures are matched with the operational philosophy and terminology: Those in custody are referred to simply as ‘men’ and the cells are ‘rooms,’” according to the project’s guidelines.“The guiding principle is that officers and staff are enablers of rehabilitation first and foremost,” the report added.But the approach has not been effective, Mr. Fairhurst, the trade union chairman, said. He also pushed back on the idea that staff members at Berwyn would knock on cell doors.“They’re prison officers, why would they knock?” he said. “They are still prisoners; there’s still violence.”About 100 prison officers demonstrated outside Berwyn in September to protest “unprecedented violence” at the prison, after reports of widespread drug use and assaults against staff members, which allegedly included employees being pushed down the stairs and spat on, the BBC reported.Mr. Fairhurst also stressed that inmates at Berwyn could not lock and unlock their cells at will. “They can lock their cell door when it’s unlocked, so that other prisoners cannot go in and steal their belongings; they can’t unlock their cells,” he said.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said in an email on Sunday that staff members at the prison “can override the locks that prisoners use when they want privacy in their cells.”The spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said of the 2017 report, “While we welcome views on how the design of new prisons could reduce reoffending by improving prisoners’ mental health and rehabilitation, this document is not a blueprint for future prisons.”In January, academics from the Universities of Bath and Leicester announced a three-year research project into whether prisons can rehabilitate offenders — and Berwyn is being studied, according to the project’s official announcement.“Some of these changes at Berwyn are relatively simple, but they might be having an important effect when it comes to making prisoners feel that they are treated with respect and decency,” Yvonne Jewkes, a professor of criminology at the University of Bath who is one of two academics leading the research, said at the time.A report published in July by an independent monitoring board for Berwyn, a body of volunteers who monitor prisoners’ welfare, found that inmates there were “treated fairly and with decency,” and said, “Berwyn will provide a practical illustration of what works well, what works less well and what can or should be discontinued.” The report covered the period from March 2017 to February 2018.The Ministry of Justice has said that as part of the wider overhaul of British prisons, the windows of new prisons in England and Wales will have toughened glass and air vents, because a government-funded study had warned that having bars was punitive. The measure was also intended to make it harder to smuggle contraband into prisons.The ministry has also said in December that more inmates would be allowed phones in their cells to help maintain family ties in an effort to improve rehabilitation and cut reoffending rates.AdvertisementSupported byBy Talya MinsbergHALF MOON BAY, Calif. — See if you can get to the end of this article without being interrupted by another piece of technology.Tristan Harris, a former Google executive, said it could be a challenge, and he compared phones and apps to slot machines that command attention and endlessly distract.In an unusual twist, Mr. Harris discussed electronic addiction at the recent New York Times New Work Summit on a stage set with candles, as the electricity in the Half Moon Bay area had gone out.When Mr. Harris worked at Google in 2013, he created a 141-page slide show that acted as a reckoning for the internet giant. What was first shared with around 10 colleagues was later viewed by tens of thousands of employees and others.“Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25-35) working at 3 companies (Google, Apple, Facebook) had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention,” the slide show read.“Think about that for a second,” he wrote. “We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.”Seven years later, worries about the addictive nature of technology have multiplied. Apple and Google have introduced tools to try to help people better understand, and curb, their technology use.Top executives in Silicon Valley are increasingly voicing their concerns about technology’s influence on young minds. Apple’s Timothy D. Cook told The Guardian he didn’t want his nephew on any social platforms. Steve Jobs didn’t want his children near iPads. Some parents are asking nannies to shield children from their phones.“Compared to 20 or 30 years ago, technology is eating up every single area of public life,” Mr. Harris said in a conversation with Meredith Whittaker of the AI Now Institute and the reporter Nellie Bowles of The Times. “From our elections, to our media, to our culture, to our public sphere, to our conversations, to our children’s development — these are all areas of life that technology has gobbled up.”In 2016, he left Google to become a co-founder and the executive director of what is now known as the Center for Humane Technology, an organization that is calling for companies to build systems and business models “that more deeply align with our humanity and how we want to live.”Mr. Harris and Ms. Whittaker say the onus to create meaningful change in the technology world must come from within and outside of companies like Apple, Facebook, Google that have a large hand in creating the expanding attention crisis.As the lead of Google’s Open Research group and an A.I. researcher at New York University, Ms. Whittaker has a unique perspective on the issues and how they could be solved from within and beyond Silicon Valley.“People are recognizing that there are issues, and they want to change it,” Ms. Whittaker said. “But has the objective function of these corporations changed? They’re still major corporations at a time of neoliberal capitalism that are optimizing their products for shareholder value.”She continued to say that users and employees must demand accountability. But government regulation is also overdue, she said.“We need regulation,” she said. “Make them open up trade secrecy provisions so we can audit these systems when they are used in public life.”Ms. Whittaker proposed those regulations as part of the 2018 AI Now Report released by New York University in December. “Government regulation is an important component,” according to the report, “but leading companies in the A.I. industry also need internal accountability structures that go beyond ethics guidelines.”Ms. Whittaker and Mr. Harris said they believed employees within the tech industry want to see specific guidelines put in place.“We have allies throughout the whole industry because no one wants bad outcomes,” Mr. Harris said. No one wants to contribute to a system in which children have poor mental health, he added. “No one wants to contribute to a system where you destabilize democracies or cause genocides across the world.”Once employees see how the current structures can lead to such problems, they ask one question, he said: “How can I help?”AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders object to a plan to privatize the V.A. system. To the Editor: Re “Privatize Care for Vets,” by Anuradha Bhagwati (Op-Ed, Feb. 4):Ms. Bhagwati’s problems are unfortunate, but it is not surprising that occasional patients in this vast system have medical experiences that are personally unsatisfactory. The great majority of patients find their care at V.A. facilities more than satisfactory. An eligible person who requests a first-time V.A. outpatient appointment must receive one within 30 days and is usually seen sooner if mental health problems are concerned. The V.A.’s computerized record-keeping system is one of the best in the country, and medical records from distant facilities are instantly available. Our costs are lower(physicians’ salaries; drugs and medical supplies bought in large quantities; expensive and unnecessary tests and procedures avoided), and our outcomes (complications and mortality for certain conditions and procedures, length of hospital stay) match or better those elsewhere in the United States.Charges to patients, if any, are preset, minimal and determined by ability to pay. The V.A. is a leader in American medical care. Its problems should be addressed and corrected. It should not be weakened or destroyed by privatization. Samuel L. RosenthalLarchmont, N.Y.The writer is an internist at the New York Harbor V.A. Medical Center.To the Editor:As a psychiatric nurse-practitioner and service member, and as a psychiatrist in the V.A. system, respectively, we are concerned that the perspective of this article may deter female veterans from receiving V.A. treatment.We are dedicated to providing trauma-informed care for veterans regardless of race, gender or sexual identification.Current initiatives support the growing female and L.G.B.T.Q. veteran population. Some of this is evidenced in our Women’s Clinic, access to female providers in a variety of subspecialties, and strides in Military Sexual Trauma identification and treatment.In our own practice and experience, we do not see this as consistent with a “hypermasculine military culture.” It would be an injustice if the opinion presented in this article served as a deterrent to treatment for other female veterans who are considering V.A. services now, or in the future.Amy RobertsShuba RodriguesWest Haven, Conn.To the Editor:Re “V.A. Rule Would Broaden Access to Private Health Care for Some Veterans” (news article, Jan. 31):The Department of Veterans Affairs has begun to shift tremendous resources, measured in billions, away from publicly provided — and therefore publicly accountable — medical and surgical care.Precisely the wrong direction!What is the big problem at the publicly run veterans hospitals and clinics? Cynically underfund a great public service and then advertise only its failures, while ignoring its fundamental and irrefutable successes.The V.A. should not be torn down, but defended and expanded — on history, on principle and especially on its superlative health outcomes. Instead of privatization, we should demand expansion of the V.A.We desperately need a national health program. We should see in the V.A. system a foundation for a national health service, able to offer excellent and accountable care for everyone in the United States.Andrew D. CoatesDelmar, N.Y. The writer, an assistant professor of medicine and psychiatry at Albany Medical College, is a past president of Physicians for a National Health Program.To the Editor:The Trump administration has embarked upon partial privatization of V.A. health care. Other superior options still available for the V.A. include increased staffing of V.A. physicians and health personnel, extended V.A. clinic hours, including evenings and weekends, and adding drop-in clinics in V.A. health facilities. Such changes would prove more efficient and less costly, and provide greater continuity and higher quality of care than shunting veterans to private vendors.The Trump administration has been less than candid in denying its intent to privatize the entire V.A. health system, a goal promoted by the Koch billionaires.AdvertisementSupported byBy Colin MoynihanLawyers for Mary Boone, the veteran art dealer who is facing possible prison time for filing false tax returns, are asking that she be spared incarceration, saying her offenses were the product of trauma, not greed.Ms. Boone is scheduled to be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty last September to two counts of filing false returns for 2011 for herself and her gallery. Federal authorities had charged her with reporting a false business loss and claiming about $1.6 million in personal expenses as business deductions.Each of the two counts carries a possible penalty of three years in prison.But in a memorandum to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan, Ms. Boone’s lawyers asked that she be sentenced instead to home confinement and probation with up to 1,000 hours of community service. Her troubled and unstable childhood led to mental health issues, a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol abuse, they wrote, and played a role in the crimes she committed. In particular, they said the poverty of her early life had left her fearful that, despite her success, she would end up destitute and dependent upon others.“Behind the facade of success and strength lies a fragile and, at times, broken individual,” the lawyers wrote in the filing made last month.The lawyers, Robert S. Fink and Michael Sardar, sent the judge a psychological evaluation of Ms. Boone and more than 100 letters attesting to her character from friends, artists, collectors and other art-world luminaries, including the Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei and the collector and philanthropist Peter Brant.Prosecutors, who have yet to file a reply memo, according to court records, declined to comment on Monday. When Ms. Boone pleaded guilty to filing false returns for 2011, prosecutors said she had engaged in similar schemes in the previous two years.Defendants routinely ask judges for leniency — requests that are often contested by prosecutors.Ms. Boone opened her gallery in Soho in 1977 and rose to prominence while showing the work of artists like Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. A vivacious and sometimes imposing figure, she became a constant in the ever-changing art world, continuing over decades to show the work of younger artists.According to her lawyers, Ms. Boone’s father died at the age of 29, when she was 3, leading to a childhood filled with “abject poverty” and grief. Her drive to succeed, they wrote, was fueled by a fear that she would “end up penniless, like her mother, and die young, like her father.”Psychological examinations show that Ms. Boone suffers from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms, her lawyers wrote. They argued that keeping Ms. Boone out of prison would enable an important business, and employer, to remain open and that her strength of character was evident in her successful fight to combat addictions to alcohol and cocaine. She has not used either in 20 years, according to the defense memo.Ms. Boone is now “repentant and remorseful,” her lawyers said, and has paid $6.9 million in taxes, interest and penalties related to her 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns.In his letter to the judge urging leniency at Ms. Boone’s sentencing, now set for Jan. 18, Mr. Ai wrote: “Through my contact with Mary I come to know that she is caring with a kind heart.”

ed Abel is mobilizing an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Iowa who are committed to improving the lives of individuals with psychiatric and neurological disorders. For him, the mission is personal.
As Ted Abel talks about his son, Seamus, he does what many proud parents often do: He whips out his phone and pulls up a photo. In it, a smiling teenager dons a black cap and gown and a bow tie. It’s an image from Seamus’s recent high school graduation ceremony.It was an exciting moment for Abel and his wife, Noreen, and one neither wants to take for granted. Completing high school was not a sure thing for Seamus. A week after his birth, the new parents were wracked with worry and fear in the neonatal intensive care unit at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Their infant had stopped eating and urinating.Source: World Economic ForumBrain imaging revealed low-grade bleeding in his ventricles, which Abel says explained the symptoms. Seamus was stabilized, though developmental pediatricians continued to closely monitor his progress. At 3, Seamus was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. He didn’t see a typical classroom until the fourth grade. Although Seamus is high-functioning — he studied AP German his senior year in high school and helped take his bocce team to the state tournament — Abel says his son encounters difficulties every day, suffers from anxiety and doesn’t have peer friendships.Source: World Economic Forum“The trajectory for him was very unclear,” Abel says, “and to be where he is today, graduating from high school, is really terrific. It’s amazing thinking back on it.” Seamus is now enrolled in an education and support program for students with autism based at the Kinney Center of Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia.When Seamus was born, Abel was a junior faculty member in neuroscience studying behavior, learning and memory at the University of Pennsylvania. Over time, his son’s diagnosis motivated him to expand his research focus to include autism. Now he leads a brain research institute at the University of Iowa and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In the last two years, Abel has published several research papers on autism, and he is poised to oversee research breakthroughs that could help his son and many others.Source: National Institute of Mental HealthSource: National Institute of Mental HealthIn 2017, Abel moved to Iowa City to become the first director of the Iowa Neuroscience Institute at the University of Iowa. Buoyed by a $45 million gift from the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust of Muscatine, Iowa, and two floors of dedicated lab space, Abel has assembled a multidisciplinary team of more than 100 scientists determined to solve the mysteries of the brain and nervous system. They intend to find causes of and develop treatments for a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, from autism and Alzheimer’s disease to stroke. The university’s Carver College of Medicine dedicated two floors of lab space to the institute in its newest biomedical research building, which also houses shared research facilities.“In other areas of medicine, like cardiology and cancer and diabetes, doctors have been able to develop tests,” Abel says. “They’ve been able to develop treatments that either delay disease, as in the case of heart disease, or treat those disorders, as in HIV. With neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders, however, we haven’t gotten there.”
Source: 2017 Annals of Neurology reportSource: 2017 Annals of Neurology reportAutism, for example, affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a recent study, Abel uncovered a clue about the male predominance in autism: Male mice that model autism showed an impaired ability to associate reward with a particular stimulus and response.“Reward learning gives us a window into a brain region called the striatum that mediates this kind of learning,” he says. “This type of learning underlies our ability to predict what will happen in the world. Many individuals on the autism spectrum have trouble predicting what will happen next or coping when what they expect to happen does not occur, leading to difficulties in social interaction and communication.”In the past decade, neuroscience has introduced techniques from physics, engineering, chemistry and biochemistry to manipulate and image circuits of nerve cells in the brain. Abel hopes to use those findings to understand how neurons in the brain work to drive behavior.Abel’s vision and energy inspire confidence in Hanna Stevens, a researcher and assistant professor of psychiatry who came to the University of Iowa from the Yale School of Medicine. She studies the genetic and environmental factors that influence early brain development and how those factors may play a role in childhood behavior or influence the risk of psychiatric disorders. She shares Abel’s commitment to improving the lives of individuals with brain disorders.“Not only do they have a major illness that puts them at a great disability, they have a society that often doesn’t take that disability seriously,” Stevens says. “People may even dismiss the disability as a character flaw or a moral failing.” Their collaboration should facilitate the development of new interventions, which is fundamental for people who are undermined by mental illness, she says, adding, “We’ll also help make the world a better place for these individuals by showing others that problems in the brain are actually causing these disorders.”If raising a son with autism has imparted one thing, it’s empathy, Abel says. He says he better understands the lives of people with neurological and psychiatric disorders and those of their families — and he is motivated to help improve their lives. Breakthroughs in brain research are forthcoming, and scientists are making advances, especially in terms of understanding genes and neural circuits, he says. Diagnoses and treatments have improved, and public awareness is growing. Acceptance of individuals with these disorders, he adds, must follow.AdvertisementSupported byThe Parkland students became a force for gun control legislation and boosted the youth vote. Here’s how they changed America’s response to mass shootings. By Margaret Kramer and Jennifer HarlanOn Feb. 14, 2018, a former student slaughtered 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The next day, David Hogg, a student who survived the attack, expressed his frustration at the pattern of political inaction that seems to follow mass shootings in the United States. He was not surprised that there had been another school shooting, he said, and that fact alone “says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.”“We need to do something,” he said. In the course of the next year, students would change the way the nation handles mass shootings, spurring new gun legislation and school safety measures, and holding to account the adults they felt had failed them.Here’s a look at where they made those changes happen, and where they were disappointed. With Parkland, it was the students who set the agenda. Their openness about their pain made them formidable leaders of the movement for gun control, and their displays of strength and utter grief struck a chord with a nation numbed by repeated acts of violence.In the weeks after the shooting, busloads of Stoneman Douglas students took their case to the Florida capital and to Washington. With a rallying cry of “Never Again,” they gathered support from other young people and activists, and their March for Our Lives campaign spurred huge rallies and hundreds of protests, including a nationwide school walkout. The students’ pleas reached the White House, imploring President Trump to better protect schools and limit access to guns. And the movement brought youth activism to a new age — finding global power in social media and pushing public officials to acknowledge their accountability. [Read how the Parkland massacre has changed the lives of the survivors in their own words.]Three months after the massacre in Parkland, 10 people were killed in yet another school shooting, this one in Santa Fe, Tex., compounding the Stoneman Douglas students’ outrage and resolve, and placing them in a new role: consoling those who were suffering as they were. “Something about Parkland has been different,” said Melissa Strassner, a survivor of the Columbine school shooting in 1999. “They truly have inspired a nation.”Stoneman Douglas students and parents were outraged by what they viewed as gross incompetence on the part of school and law enforcement officials. Video showed that a sheriff’s deputy assigned to the school did not enter the building as the attack unfolded. Seven other deputies remained outside as gunshots rang out, a state commission found. And another officer prevented paramedics from entering.The school district also appeared to have missed several warning signs about the former student charged in the massacre, Nikolas Cruz. The parents of two 14-year-old students who were killed decided to run for the school board to fix what they thought went wrong. One of them won.And in January, Florida’s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, suspended Sheriff Scott Israel for his “neglect of duty” and “incompetence.” Mr. Israel, who is a Democrat and a vocal opponent of the National Rifle Association, continues to insist that the criticism of him is politically motivated and that “there was no wrongdoing on my part.” Multiple deputies have also been suspended, and one ultimately resigned.In the case of Mr. Cruz, the warning signs were many. There were the boasts about killing animals, the expulsion, the stalking of a female classmate, the repeated calls from his mother to the police. School counselors and a sheriff’s deputy decided at one point that he should be forcibly committed for psychiatric evaluation, only to apparently change their minds the next day. Multiple tips to the F.B.I. were left uninvestigated — one woman told the bureau’s tip line she was worried about Mr. Cruz going “into a school and just shooting the place up.” At that time, there was no law in Florida that would have prevented Mr. Cruz from buying a gun or would have allowed the police to take away his weapon. A gun control bill the state passed in March now allows law enforcement — with judicial approval — to bar a person deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a year. Florida courts granted more than 1,000 such orders in the first nine months after the law took effect, according to The Associated Press. Eight other states have passed similar “red flag” laws in the last year, bringing the total with such laws to 14. Several more states are expected to take up measures in 2019.State legislatures, both Republican- and Democratic-controlled, passed 76 gun control laws in the past year  — from bans on bump stocks and caps on magazine sizes to new minimum-age requirements and expanded background checks. Among the victories for gun control advocates was an omnibus bill in Florida that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm in the state to 21 and extended the waiting period to three days. In all, more than half the states passed at least one gun control measure in 2018, with Washington and New York joining the trend in 2019. At the same time, there were significantly fewer new state laws expanding gun rights in 2018 than the year before, according to an end-of-year report by the national advocacy group Giffords. Data provided by the N.R.A. also indicated that the number of enacted gun control measures outnumbered pro-gun measures for the first time in at least six years.But at the federal level, any momentum for change was quickly stymied by partisan gridlock. Republican leaders in Congress remained silent as their Democratic colleagues called, once again, for changes in the wake of a mass shooting. The White House flip-flopped on promises to raise the minimum age to purchase rifles and to enforce universal background checks. And the N.R.A. pressed lawmakers, including the president, to give priority to the interests of gun owners.[Nearly 1,200 children have been killed by gun violence since the shooting in Parkland. Read how teenage journalists told their stories.]In the end, the only significant national change was a ban on bump stocks — which members of both parties had been calling for since the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017. The House of Representatives, where Democrats took power in January, has now made gun safety a priority, and the Judiciary Committee passed two gun-control bills on Wednesday that would strengthen background checks and close a loophole that allowed Dylann S. Roof to buy a gun that he used in the Charleston church massacre in 2015. But with a Republican Senate and president, the chances of either measure moving beyond the House are virtually nil.In the days after Parkland, a flood of threats and false alarms heightened the focus on school security nationwide. Schools have turned to an array of measures: hiring armed guards, requiring students to carry clear backpacks, arming teachers with baseball bats. Some campuses have added more cameras and metal detectors or hired companies to monitor students’ social media for potential threats — all of which has created a lucrative market for school security.The president voiced support in the days after Parkland for arming teachers with guns as a way to prevent further massacres. It was an early indicator of the tack that he and congressional Republicans would take in addressing the shooting. In March, Mr. Trump announced the creation of a federal commission to examine school safety proposals, including raising the minimum age for buying certain firearms. But two months later, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos informed a Senate committee that the commission would not look at the role guns play in school violence. Its final report played down the role of guns, and advised schools to improve mental health services and train school personnel to use firearms.When it became clear that Congress would not act on guns, the Parkland students turned their attention to rallying young voters and increasing turnout in the midterm elections in November.Madison Leal, a student at Stoneman Douglas, said in March about politicians who would not take action: “I’m going to vote them out of office. And so is my entire generation. And they’ll be sorry then.” In the summer, a busload of students traveled the country on a Road to Change tour aimed at registering young voters. In tandem with various voter groups and celebrities promoting registration, the Parkland students helped spike record numbers for young voter registration, registering thousands of voters at their rallies. The March for Our Lives campaign reported a 10 percent increase in youth turnout in 2018, compared with the previous midterm elections in 2014.AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressLisa Love hasn't seen her doctor of 25 years since she discovered telemedicine.Love tried virtual visits last summer for help with a skin irritation and returned for another minor problem. She doesn't feel a pressing need to seek care the old-fashioned way, especially since she also gets free health screenings at work.No more waiting for the doctor's office to open. Convenience rules in health care now, where patients can use technology or growing options like walk-in clinics and urgent care centers to get help whenever they need it.A survey last year found that about a quarter of U.S. adults don't have a regular doctor. Some like Love wonder how much they still need one."Telemedicine probably can't do everything ... but for most of the things I might ever have, I'm pretty sure they can take care of it," the Twin Falls, Idaho, resident said.Health care experts say the changing, fragmented nature of care is precisely why people still need someone who looks out for their overall health, which is the traditional role of primary care physicians like family doctors and internists.They know patients' medical histories, and they're trained to spot problems that may be developing instead of just addressing symptoms that prompted the patient's visit. They also can make sure medications don't conflict with regular prescriptions, and they can help make sense of the information patients dig up with a Google search.But the nature of primary care is changing as patients branch off to drugstore clinics and urgent care centers. Practices are slowly shifting to more of a team-based approach that focuses on keeping patients healthy and reserves visits with a doctor for the more serious cases."The idea that the primary care physician is the one-size-fits-all solution ... that's going to change pretty dramatically," said Sam Glick, an executive with the research firm Oliver Wyman.This evolution began years ago when drugstores started providing flu shots and opening clinics that handle minor issues like ear infections or pink eye. The two largest chains, CVS Health and Walgreens, now run about 1,500 clinics combined.More recently, employers have started adding worksite clinics, and thousands of urgent care centers have opened around the country to treat emergencies that aren't life-threatening. Then there's telemedicine, which patients can use to connect to a doctor in minutes without leaving their home or office.Love said she's hooked on virtual visits. They only cost $42, or less than half the price of an office visit under her insurance plan."I like technology and I like new things and I like saving money," Love said. "It was worth it to me to try it."About 25% of adults don't have a regular doctor, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation found last year. That jumps to 45% for those under age 30.On top of all the competition for patients, the field also is fighting a shortage of doctors as medical school students opt for higher-paying specialties.Primary care practices have adjusted by adding physician assistants or nurse practitioners to handle annual physicals and other routine care.They're also creating teams that help them take a broader look at patient health. Those teams might include mental health specialists who screen for depression and health coaches who can improve diet and exercise.The idea is to keep patients healthy instead of waiting to treat them after they become sick."We want to do as much outside the walls of the clinic as we can," said Stanford University's Dr. Megan Mahoney, noting that this push depends on insurers expanding what they will cover.Doctors also are continuing to focus more on coordinating care for people with complex health needs.Bryant Campbell's care team includes a primary care doctor, a pharmacist and specialists to help manage his chronic liver condition and rheumatoid arthritis. The Portland, Oregon, man said his team members talk frequently to avoid problems like duplicate tests, and their approach gives him more confidence."I sometimes think as patients we feel isolated in our health care, and this team-based approach helps a patient be as involved as you need or want to be," he said.Doctors say the expanded scope of their practices is changing how they interact with patients. Dr. Russell Phillips frequently responds to email or cellphone questions from his patients. He also refers them to clinics for minor issues like urinary tract infections.The Harvard Medical School professor says primary care is evolving into more of a flowing, virtual relationship where patients have more frequent but briefer contact with their doctor's office instead of just office visits maybe twice a year."Getting medical care is such a complex activity that people really need somebody who can advise, guide and coordinate for them," Phillips said. "People still really want a relationship with someone who can do that."___Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: @thpmurphyAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSALEM, Ore. — Oregon's foster care system has failed to shield children from abuse and they are sometimes forced to stay in refurbished jail cells and homeless shelters, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.The 77-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court details stories of foster children being neglected or harmed while under Department of Human Services care, including a 16-year-old girl sent to a juvenile jail after she had previously tried to kill herself.The agency has weathered years criticism over the way it treats children and has paid out tens of millions of dollars to settle previous complaints.The lawsuit also comes as the state agency fights off criticism from lawmakers over a recent news report that found a 9-year-old girl had been placed in an out-of-state residential facility in Montana, where she was injected with Benadryl to control her behavior and went without visits from a caseworker for six months. More than 80 children are housed outside Oregon."The big problem is that Oregon has failed to develop specialized placements or even enough placements for kids in care," said Marcia Lowry, executive director of A Better Childhood, one of the nonprofits behind the lawsuit. "Oregon goes well beyond what even the national problems are."In a statement, DHS Director Fariborz Pakseresht said the agency is committed to finding children appropriate placement, especially those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. He said it is taking steps to address the problems identified in the lawsuit, and is finalizing a long-term, statewide plan to recruit more foster families.DHS also plans to reassess its use of out-of-state facilities, he said.At a legislative hearing last week, Pakseresht recognized flaws within the system, but maintained that the agency still provides quality services for the 7,500 youth in its care."We do make mistakes," Pakseresht told lawmakers. "A few mistakes - 10 mistakes, 20 mistakes, 30 mistakes - are never acceptable, but they don't constitute a system that is broken."Since 2006, the agency has paid $39 million in legal settlements over allegations of abuse and neglect. But Christine Shank, one of the managing lawyers in the case, said the fundamental problems within DHS haven't changed."We're hoping this case can really be a catalyst for systemic change," said Shank, a lawyer with Disability Rights Oregon.In the case of the 16-year-old girl, lawyers say she landed in state care after her father refused to get her mental health services. Her lawyers say she remained without therapy as she was shuffled between facilities, including homeless shelters, out of a lack of placement options.At the Klamath Falls, Oregon, facility, which houses both juvenile inmates and at-risk foster youth, lawyers say the girl lived in a cinder-block cell where she couldn't keep any personal items except a book. She underwent daily extensive treatment for substance and sexual abuse, despite having never suffered from either. She had individualized therapy once a week, which her lawyers called inadequate.The lawsuit argues DHS hasn't done enough to shield children from abuse and neglect, a violation of their federal due process rights. The lawsuit also says the department has failed to provide foster children with a permanent, stable living situation.A 2016 federal audit found only 20% of foster children had "permanency and stability in their living conditions," while the majority were placed with foster parents who "may not have had the necessary skills" to care for them. The department made "concerted efforts" to provide children with permanent homes in 41% of cases.Elizabeth Graves, who is not associated with the lawsuit, said she entered DHS care when she was 13, and was moved between 15 foster and group homes within five years. Now 27, she said she still suffers from nightmares over the emotional abuse she endured.She became pregnant at 15, and said her circumstances began to improve when was sent to a Portland facility specifically serving girls who have young children or are pregnant. She received individualized attention plus parenting lessons.But, less than an hour after Graves gave birth, she said DHS intervened and put her son up for adoption. According to Graves, her caseworker had determined she was too young to care for the child."I did everything to prepare for him," she told The Associated Press. "I spent all that time at the group home learning how to take care of him and even set up a room for him. I cried and begged but they just took him from me."She now works as a credit card banker in Portland."I wouldn't have experienced the trauma I have today if I wasn't in foster care," she said. "I really hope this lawsuit finally does something. Kids are suffering and nobody is doing anything."AdvertisementSupported byNovelty tips for people with moods.By Ellie ShechetIt appears once again that February has arrived, as it manages to every year, though it wasn’t exactly invited. The world is dark and postures are slumped as people trudge around in floor-length puffer coats, hunching inward for warmth like a dreary colony of sun-starved caterpillars. In New York City, a strained quiet has settled in, punctuated only by the hiss of a thousand radiators.Every year, troves of self-help articles are published to prepare us for the inevitable “winter blues.” Like struggling “America’s Next Top Model” contestants, we seem to have trouble remembering how to “find our light” in the darker months, each year requiring regular prodding and tips on making it through the season. And maintaining the willpower (and, more crucially, finding the time or money) to keep our moods buoyant, or at least intact, can feel like an uphill battle.Technically, only about 6 percent of the population of the United States has Seasonal Affective Disorder, a form of depression that is commonly understood as a winter affliction, though it can occur at other times of the year. But less debilitating dips in mood affect many of us. The culprit — it is largely believed — is our circadian rhythm, which gets disrupted when the days get shorter and the nights get longer, beginning around the end of daylight saving time.“During the wintertime, people notice that they’re lethargic, they’re tired and they lose some interest in things,” said Dr. Ravi Shah, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. “And that can be mild and subtle, or it can be more severe.”There are some tried and true methods for dealing with this: Over 60 clinical studies have demonstrated that light therapy alleviates seasonal depression symptoms. And modifications to diet (Dr. Shah recommends the Mediterranean diet, with its emphasis on seafood, olive oil, whole grains, fruits and veggies over sugar and highly processed foods), exercise regimens (try to get your heart rate up 20 minutes per day), alcohol consumption (drink less) and sleep (most people need seven to nine hours) are crucial.[Here are our recommended light therapy lamps.]If you’re experiencing symptoms of depression, you should consult with a licensed medical professional for diagnosis and treatment. But if it’s novelty solutions you seek, I asked around to find some other winter rituals that might help.They may, at least, distract you.Plant-based remedies are by no means new, with deep roots in traditional Chinese medicine and indigenous cultures, but herbalism has become increasingly popular. Herbal remedies are unregulated by the FDA and many lack strong support from scientific studies, but the uptick in interest among consumers has been “unbelievable,” said Adriana Ayales, the owner of Anima Mundi apothecary in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For a winter mood boost, Ms. Ayales recommends raw cacao, which she describes as “kind of like a sunshine powder.” Another big seller right now is Anima Mundi’s “Happiness Tonic,” which contains herbs like rhodiola, an “adaptogen” that was traditionally used for stress relief, and St. John’s Wort, which some limited studies have suggested may help treat mild depression (though the latter can interact with a wide variety of medications, so should be taken in consultation with a doctor). If nothing else, get yourself some lavender. It is a stress reliever (at least, for mice) and it smells great.I am annoying even myself with this suggestion, but it has its merits: There’s some evidence that the practice of writing down what you’re grateful for can improve your mood. Advanced practitioners may even find positive things to say about the weather. “I kind of like the winter because it’s an excuse to not socialize, or socialize only at chili nights and holiday parties, which are really superior forms of socialization,” an optimistic friend recently told me. Interesting theory! Maybe it’s worth expanding on … in a journal entry.Energy therapy is not exactly a science, but reiki and other alternative healing touch practices have become practically ubiquitous. Reiki is even offered at some hospitals as a gentle complementary treatment. But you don’t need to shell out for a private session to “shift your energetic field,” said Aki Hirata Baker, a reiki practitioner and a co-founder of Minka, a social justice-oriented wellness center in Brooklyn.For urban clients feeling claustrophobic and overwhelmed, squished into globs of stinking humanity on the subway and in other small indoor spaces, Ms. Baker advises doing visualizations. In her own classes, she said she asks students: “What’s the strongest color they can imagine, or what’s the strongest material they can imagine?” Then she encourages them to “see that image, the color or the material, whooshing out of their skin to fill up their personal space, so they feel that they have more protection around their body.” Plants may be all the rage right now, but being in their presence has always had therapeutic benefits (and, you know, we need them to breathe). If buying a plant of your own isn’t on the menu, take a trip to a plant store, a greenhouse or a botanical garden and just hang out for a bit.“When people are able to connect with nature, there are physical benefits,” said Joanne D’Auria, a school tour coordinator at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The garden hosts “Chase Away the Winter Blues” outdoor tours between December and March, as well as tours of their indoor conservatory spaces. “The whole idea of seeing something green and beautiful is very uplifting,” Ms. D’Auria said.Me? I’m afraid of crockpots. They seem suspiciously simple. But cozy soups and stews, however simply made, are undeniably one of the upsides of winter.“Stews and slowly simmered curries and dals and steamy bubbling stuff just smell so homey and comforting as they cook,” said Liana Krissoff, author of “Slow Cook Modern,” a book of recipes. “And if you’re using a slow cooker, you can kind of get that effect even if you can’t spend the whole day tending a pot on the stove.”Coming home to a slow-cooked meal after being tensed up in the cold can make you feel taken care of, even if you’re the one taking care of yourself, Ms. Krissoff explained. “Like: Thanks, Morning Me, for thinking to make this. It smells really good.”The new Netflix show “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo” suggests, almost convincingly, that one’s life can be transformed simply by folding one’s pants into labor-intensive upright triangles. But decluttering is just generally good for combatting cabin fever. Ms. Kondo, whose 2014 book “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” became an international phenomenon, preaches that you must only preserve and thoughtfully organize items that “spark joy,” and politely thank and then discard the items that don’t. I’m keeping my socks though. Scented candles and other cozy fragrance-makers are kind of a no-brainer when it comes to winterizing one’s home, but CJ Powers, owner and founder of Scenthouse LA, an interior fragrance company, has some guidelines.“I think the worst thing you could do in the winter is fragrance counterprogramming,” Mr. Powers said. By that he means don’t light a candle that smells like the beach. “Embrace the winter, and dive head-on in with comforting, winter fragrances that wrap you in their complexity,” he said. For affordable options, try a woodsy scented candle like Teakwood & Tobacco from P.F. Candle Co. Or, Mr. Powers offered, just bake a batch of cookies. Alternatively, if you want your body to smell like styrax resin and cedar leaves, perfumes evoking chilly weather are having a moment.When it gets cold out, it’s easy to “cocoon ourselves” at home, said Miriam Kirmayer, a therapist and friendship expert. It can also be difficult to drag friends out of their respective cocoons. But Ms. Kirmayer says friendships are, unsurprisingly, “essential for our health and well-being.” (And research shows that loneliness and perceived isolation can affect our mental health.) So it’s worth putting in a little more effort during the colder months. Ms. Kirmayer recommends weekly “Bachelor” viewing parties, exercise dates or some plain old one-on-one time. Organizing a social gathering can also be fun. Or, as my roommate put it, “psychotically planning a dinner party for 15 people one month in advance means I can think constantly about what appetizers to serve instead of my own gnawing mortality.”Do I need an expert to tell you this? We’ve all heard that staring at our phones, computers and tablets all day, every day is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. And although a lot of us don’t have a choice during the workweek, we probably don’t need to spend our off hours looking at Kacey Musgraves’s wedding pictures on Instagram. AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationBy The Learning NetworkIf you read our Current Events Conversation regularly, you know that one thing we love to see is students talking to each other in the comments section. It’s an excellent way to practice your civil discourse skills, learn about people who are different from you and connect with other teenagers from all over the world.We want to highlight some of the ways students respectfully and productively engaged with each other on our site this week. If you’re looking to spark a conversation with your fellow commenters, here are a few ideas to get you started:• Respectfully reply to comments you disagree with, offering more evidence, a different perspective or a counterpoint, like Justin Pfeifer from Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C., did on our Student Opinion question, “Should the U.S. Ban Military-Style Semiautomatic Weapons?” and Benea Quintero from Arizona did on “Do You Have Satisfying Friendships?”• Ask questions to push the conversation further, like sowda mohamed from Minnesota did on our question, “Should We Abolish the Death Penalty?”• Leave a note on the comments that speak to you and tell the writer why, like Kate Schaefers from Minnesota and Kara from Hawaii did on our prompt, “What Legacy Do You Want to Leave Behind?”• Or, simply hit the “Recommend” button to let others know you liked what they had to say, like many did on our Picture Prompt “$430 Million Deal.”Students, what else can you add to the conversation? We’d love to see more of you talking to your fellow commenters. We’ll keep a look out for it this week and we might even call you out in next week’s Current Events Conversation.And, before we go, welcome to new classes from: Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Minnesota; and Point Pleasant Borough High School, N.J.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.__________In “Want to Leave a Legacy? Be a Mentor,” Jane E. Brody writes that making a positive impact in the lives of others is a surefire way to be remembered after one’s physical life ends — more so than leaving behind money, structures or other objects. In our related Student Opinion question, we asked whether students agreed with Ms. Brody and what legacy they want to leave in the world.We were struck by the thoughtfulness and range of responses we received. While many wrote that, like Ms. Brody, they hoped to be a positive presence in the lives of loved ones and strangers, others wrote about leaving a legacy through meaningful work, lasting ideas, tangible things, community service and just being themselves.Living on in the memories and lives of othersWhen I think of leaving a mark on the world, a legacy, I think of doing the small things. Holding open the door for someone, picking up a dropped pencil, or just smiling at someone passing by. Yes, most of these things are not life altering and jaw dropping acts, however I hope that these little things can change someones life, even for a few seconds. I’m not looking to be remembered by thousands, or even hundreds. I just hope that I am able to share the kindness that others have shown me through my actions and words.— Abby Bowker, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NCBeing a sophomore in high school we are not only being asked, “ What do you want to be when you grow up,” but we are also being asked, “How are you going to make a difference in this world?” I am constantly changing my mind about what I want to do in the world and what I want to leave behind. When I think about my future I think about having kids and being a mom. Not only will care and love them but I want them to look up to me. Although it would be cool to be famous or have some type of revolutionary invention, that is not what I value most. I want to have a stable family and be able to provide for the people I love.— Caroline Dixon, Hoggard Highschool Wilmington, NCOne of my fears is to have existed and not have a record of my existence. If only one person would keep me in their heart and mind, then i have succeeded as being someone worth remembering.— Nyleah F., Providence, Rhode IslandMaking a lasting impact through meaningful workWhen I am older, the job I want to pursue is neonatal nursing. I want my part of my impact on the world to be helping premature babies recover and get healthy. My goal is to help hundreds of babies leave the hospital and go home healthy.— Gules P, North Hunterdon High SchoolMy legacy is to bring positivity into people’s lives. I am not in the music making for money, or fame, because the money and fame does not last forever, but the music and positivity will live on with people to remember the way I could have changed there life, or I could have helped them out of a problem. I want to know that I did something big and I touched many people’s lives.— Kaiden Forbes, Oxford Middle SchoolI want to be remembered as a leader. Being a leader is the most important aspect of my life and going down in history as one would be an acceptable legacy. Legacy tends to never be the actions of one man, but rather the actions that causes others to join the cause … Leadership is my outlet for helping others because it goes beyond inspiring someone to do something; it actually help them achieve their goal.— Liam S, NJWhen I grow up I want to be a pediatrician, so it would only make sense that I would want to help others and be remembered as such. I want people to see me as someone who helps them achieve their dreams, or helps to make them feel better.— Adenike A, North Hunterdon HighschoolI hope that I can pursue a career as a film director and create films that earn their legacy by entertaining, provoking, and enriching viewers.— Dylan Itkin, Providence, RIObjects with special meaningThe idea of legacy has been on my mind ever since I was little, when my father passed away. Growing up, there were times when I felt lost, realizing all the connections I should have had with him that I didn’t. I don’t have any memories with him, only stories of him told to me by my grandmother. I felt I had no way to cherish his memory and keep him living on. His death made me wonder about legacy itself. What had he left on this earth?To me, his life had been snuffed out too quickly; he had left nothing behind but his family. If only my family and a few close friends knew him, what would happen to his legacy when we are all gone? This is when I believe stories of good deeds don’t cut it when attempting to make a personal connection. Whenever I find something new of my father’s, whether it’s a Swiss Army knife, a voltmeter, or tons of records from one of my favorite bands, The Beatles, I learn something more about him, something that just couldn’t be told in a story from my grandmother.At times, the things you leave behind can be a better legacy than stories of the good days of your time on Earth. Although I know my father was a good man, these stories aren’t what help me keep his memory alive. There are times when just putting on a Beatles song makes me feel entirely more connected. After all, like Erik Erikson said, “I am what survives me,” and at the end of the day, a Swiss Army knife’s steel will survive longer than the spoken word.— Michelle Lamas, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCI believe that the impact someone has on others far outways the amount of money they have to their name. However, money can be an aid in helping others. For example, Bill Gates is not just known for his riches, but for the philanthropic work he does with those riches. He uses his wealth as a tool to help others, and his legacy will reflect that.Therefore, money is irrelevant to a legacy if that money is kept to oneself. I believe it works the other way as well.— Jack H, North Hunterdon High SchoolBeing remembered for being yourselfI guess, overall, I just want people to remember me as “an okay human being who lived the life she wanted”. I don’t feel the need to have a grand legacy, simple is just fine if it means I lived my life happily and on my own terms.— Avery Galloway, Hoggard High school, Wilmington, NC@Avery Galloway I love how you framed legacy as “an okay human being who lived the life she wanted.” I think legacy is about living each day living out your values. Being a good person, being kind, patient with others … all of these create a lived legacy. And the life she wanted - that is important too. Live your own life, follow your own dreams, be the person you want to be. That is a legacy.— Kate Schaefers, MinnesotaThe best legacy anyone could leave behind is that they were true to their own self. So stop doing things you don’t want to just for your legacy. Stop doing things that you hope will make a good impression on someone. Just go out and live your life the way you want to live it That way when you do pass away everyone will remember you for the person that lived the way they wanted to. That lived happily because they weren’t constantly trying to please others.— JP Kelter, MAThe people who have inspired us to leave a legacy of our ownSome people have been really inspiring to me just by being themselves. I don’t think one necessarily has to try to make an impact on someone else. I’ve always looked up to my karate sensei because he is really smart and teaches important values to his students. Even his sensei, who I never met before he died, has left an imprint on so many people, including me. My sensei once quoted something he heard him say: “Get up. Dress up. Show up.” … I don’t aspire to be remembered as great, or even remembered at all. But I’d be glad to make give someone strength, just by being me.— Serena, Walla WallaMy great grandpa’s name was Jacob Gartner … Though I was young, he used to give me advice whenever he can and I still remember most of what he said. “Always fight for what you believe in,” that’s what he did. “Put the work in now, it will pay off later” was another one. I know you can hear this anywhere but when it came from him, it truly meant something to me. He had so many of these it could fill a book.This is the kind of legacy I want to leave behind. I want to leave this earth knowing that I have somehow impacted the generation below me. That they will become a better person because of something I had said or done, direct or indirect. I want to make an impact so they can do the same.— Ethan Fedor, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCYes, I agree with that leaving a positive impact on people is more memorable than tangible objects. I believe this because your positive impact can last for generations and generations and when people hear your name it will put a smile on their face … For Example Martin Luther King jr. left a positive impact on the world by preaching that blacks and whites should come together … The effect and message he preached left a long lasting effect on everybody and it will continue to have an effect on people for generations to come. I believe that is worth more than leaving behind money or a house.— Dylan C, North Hunterdon High SchoolIn The Snows of Kilimanjaro, our main character Harry left nothing behind. He had many stories and intended to make an impact, but never got around to do it. He was left with no legacy, no children, nothing to keep his name alive. This idea to me inspires me to create something that will outlive me. It could be a book, a piece of art, or even wisdom passed down from my family to the next.— MP, New JerseyI had a person in my life who left an impact on me when I was young. Her name was Ms. Dee and she was a volunteer at my local library … I was so infatuated with the stories she told me and how kind she was to me, but the most important thing that she did was help me gain more confidence in myself and show me how much potential I have. Without her I would not be confident in myself or know my own self worth. Just like her, I want to help someone see the full potential they have and help them grow into a better person, just like Ms.Dee did to me because it is important to “focus on being there” for the next generation after us.— Lola Adebayo, Providence, RI__________We were super inspired by these photos of the March 15 youth climate strikes around the world, so we used one in our Picture Prompt “Student Climate Strikes.”The teenagers on our site were just as moved. “I have never really been big in the climate change movement but after reading this article I am really encouraged to join the movement. I am very proud of our world for all the people that missed work and school and protest for this,” Julian Atacan from Masterman: Philadelphia wrote.We asked students what other issues in their communities or the world they thought deserved more attention. Here’s what they had to say:Climate changeI think that climate change and clean air is the most important issue to be focusing on. Even if we solve homelessness, and things like world hunger, it won’t matter in the grand scheme of things if we cannot preserve the planet and we won’t have a planet to live on. If I were to fight for any issue, it would probably be climate change. I am glad that these kids are fighting for the planet, and their place to live. It matters to me because if we can’t make a change in the way we are going about things, the human race will be extinct before we know it. Anything that can contribute to saving the planet is something we should try to implement into our everyday lives. Recycling, cutting down on plastic, and not buying Carbon Dioxide products are examples of steps we can take to help save our planet.— Arjun Ahya, Masterman School, Philadelphia PAEducationEducation is an issue that is often overlooked, but by giving more people access to a quality education, more people can contribute to the solutions for other problems. Through education, women’s rights, environmental protection, family planning, equality, and economic stability can be advanced. We need to reorder our priorities and implement widespread education in all parts of the world.— Emma Johnson, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NCPolice brutalityI feel as though an issue in my community that normally gets overlooked is police brutality. I see everywhere over social media about people getting racially profiled for absolutely no reason and there is no justice for them. Sometimes the police officers get away with it and still get to keep their jobs and still do the same shady work. This just gets overlooked and the only times people get outraged, the most that happens to the officer is that they get suspended or kicked from the force but that won’t bring justice to the family that is mourning the loss of their sibling or children that got their life taking because of an “accident” that just so happens to occur from time to time. And most of the time, it’s the same exact story! I’m not saying that all cops are bad and untrustworthy, because not all cops are bad, I am just saying we need to bring justice to the cops that take an innocent life or racially profile someone for no reason. That is an issue that I would most likely take a stand for.— Abdoul Diallo, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaMen’s issuesPerhaps one of the most important issues, at least I believe it to be, is seen as almost taboo to talk about. I’m referring to men’s issues … Why can’t we talk about the higher suicide rate of men? Why can’t we talk about the lower life expectancy of men? Why can’t we talk about the harsher prison sentences, and unfair treatment in court for men? Why can’t we talk about the lack of father figures for men, particularly in inner cities? Why can’t we talk about the lack of representation for what actual masculinity is and should be? These issues and hundreds more are very real, and go unaddressed. Not once have I heard anyone talking about these issues in every day life. Not even by myself, because I’m too afraid to bring them up for fear of being called misogynist or sexist, or just having them rejected.— Keegan Butler, Danvers MAGentrificationIn my opinion, The problem that I think the people in my community should focus on the most is gentrification. Gentrification is when richer people or people of the higher class move to an area of lower class and try to make it Higher class and what it isn’t. I think this is a problem because my neighborhood is perfect the way it is (I think), but the rich people think that it needs work and that they can make it better and more fit for them because they may like the location but not the actual community. It just gets on my nerves because they think just because they have money, they can go to any neighborhood and raise the expectations of the people who own apartments and places to live so that the people who were there first will have a much harder time paying for it etc. I would take a stand on the topic of homelessness and poverty because this is also a slight problem in my neighborhood. I think that I would stand on this because I hate to see people suffer like that everywhere in the world.— Azalea Derrickson, Masterman School,PhillyDeforestationOne issue that I think deserves more attention is deforestation as well as the destruction of any of the other few untouched places on this planet. These places are the home of many animals that would go extinct if we do not stop destroying these places. It is important to preserve areas like these because, not only do they house many amazing animals, but many of these areas, such as the Amazon Rainforest (from 2017-2018, around 3,050 square miles of the Amazon was cleared) also provide oxygen for much of our planet and, as human beings, we need oxygen to survive. These few preserved places are not only valuable because they benefit us and other creatures, but also because they have value in their own right. The forests and mountains and plains were formed by chance. They were not formed explicitly for our benefit or to satisfy our endless greed. We cannot destroy these places for lumber or oil or iron because those few filthy rich individuals at the head of the companies that benefit from this destruction want more money.— Amalia T., Masterman, PhiladelphiaGender equalityI think gender inequality is an issue that needs more attention. I think so many people aren’t earning the credit that they deserve. People work so hard to fight inequality just to be pushed away. Gender inequality isn’t just for females. It applies to males as well. The gender stereotypes, the LGBTQ+ community, the amount of money people are paid etc. This matters to me because I am a very strong believer of equality and equal rights for everyone no matter their color, gender, race, religion or anything near those terms. This stands out for me especially because this isn’t anything that is new. This has been going on since forever. “Boys can’t like pink,” “girls should be at home washing dishes.”— Havana C, Masterman: Philadelphia, PAAnother current issue I feel very strongly about is feminism and gender equality, meaning politically, in the workplace and in everyday life. Currently, some forms of feminism are viewed as unnecessary and are only believed to exist because “women want attention and want more power than men”. I can’t say I blame the men who do not recognize the inequalities women, specifically black, indigenous and transgender women face everyday. Most men have not felt the fear of being cat called, most men have not had to sit down with their mother and be told why they can’t go certain places with certain people. Most men do not fear for their lives when walking home alone on a certain road. Most men do not fear that when they get older, another human would put something in their drink to lure them back to their apartment. Most men do not feel the fear I feel when a man enters an empty elevator alone with them. Most men have not felt the fear of being a woman in America.Raiin.org says, “Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault”. Additionally, “Of women who are raped in their lifetime: 17.9% are Caucasian,11.9% are Latina, 18.8% are African-American, 34.1% are American Indian or Alaskan Native..”. There is no wonder that young girls are fearful for what their future in our messed up, rickety and flimsy American society may hold.— Angela Xhori, Julia R. Masterman, PhiladelphiaMental healthI think an issue that deserves more attention is mental health awareness, especially for teens. It’s frustrating that mental health is one of those things I only hear in hushed whispers. It’s frustrating that my friend’s mom thinks she can cure her with essential oils but thinks that medication will harm her. It’s frustrating when schools encourage the decline of mental health by piling on homework and telling students to get it done by any means necessary. It’s frustrating when my guidance counselor says my grades are too high for me to be depressed, and that I should just stop procrastinating. It’s frustrating when my classmates make fun of me for something I can’t control. It’s frustrating seeing all of this misinformation about mental health, and it’s sad that adults aren’t willing to do more to educate us about it.There are kids out there with mental illnesses who don’t know they have mental illness because they don’t know what they are. There are kids out there who aren’t able to get treatment for their mental illnesses because their parents don’t know what they are or are misinformed about them. 1 in 5 teens has a mental illness. 1 in 13 teens has asthma. How come schools talk about asthma more than mental illness? If this many teens have a mental illness then we should be more supportive of them. If this many teens have a mental illness we should talk more about them.— Ami S, Masterman, PhiladelphiaFor our Picture Prompt “Hole in the Ceiling,” we invited students to use the above illustration as inspiration for the opening of a short story, poem or memoir. We loved the poetic nature of each of these pieces. Many students wove in literary devices that made these stories just as dreamy as the moon and stars themselves.FreedomHer whole life she has lived in this box, trapped by the walls that confine her. She doesn’t even know how much is beyond this room, all she knows are these walls. This angers me. I have to do something about it, I can’t just sit here and let her live the rest of her life not knowing how free she can be. I decide to take action instantly. I grab a nearby saw and start cutting away at the roof. She is horrified, her whole life is getting cut into pieces right in-front of her. Once I finish the hole she looks out. Her teary eyes turned confused and then amazed. She had finally seen the outside, she finally knew that there was more in this world than her room, she finally knew that she was free.— Wyatt Young, Hoggard High SchoolThe stars and the moonI miss the stars and the moon Out by the country sides We lived by a lagoon But modern life bides We now go on in boxes Hopeful this wasn’t hoaxes She misses them too At this point, it’s my cue As she snuggles with her stuffed roo I wield a saw and whip it up to the roof and sue Now the stars and moon shine brighter Since we are reunited again, but tighter— Catherine L. Hoerner, Walla Walla High SchoolA touch of moonlightShe had always yearned for the touch of moonlight on her skin. She knew it to be only a dream, for she was trapped in a room, her only companion the light-blue blanket she kept at her side at all times. She continually dreamed for the day that her prince would come for her, and they would gaze upon the stars together, her dream coming to life.Today was another ordinary day, the girl lay in bed and gazed at the ceiling, imagining how the stars would wink at her as if to say, “You’re not alone.”She snapped her eyes shut, not wanting to believe that this small room was all that waited for her. She gripped the blanket tightly and ducked underneath the covers, wanting the nightmare to end. There would be no prince charming for someone like her, abandoned by her own parents and forgotten by her so-called friends.Minutes, hours passed and the girl lay under her beloved blanket thinking, not wanting to believe she heard the soothing sound of metal on wood. Not being able to take it anymore, she sat upright and blinked up at the sky, not wanting to believe it.On her bed stood a man, unlike any man she had encountered before. He smiled down at her as if wanting to say, “I’m sorry I took so long.” The girl gasped and stared at the hole in her ceiling. She sat paralyzed and watched the stars twinkling. It was better than anything she could have imagined. Tears blurred the girl’s vision as she looked at the man and said, “Thank you.”— Kiara Martinez, Walla Walla High School SchoolDon’t let this room limit your dreamsThere, you see? That crescent you see on the sky. It’s what many people try to reach even though they know it’s too far. But the Americans knew nothing about that , they just went and came knowing that they beat the Russians by setting a foot on it.ButIt’s not just about reaching the moon or even the stars. It’s about setting a goal that seem impossible for man to get. But what happen if you reach it? What happens when you have it all? Then you Worry about losing it. You start to wonder: what if someone else will accomplish that goal better? And even worse, get recognized for it and not I.ButIt’s not about that, it’s about accomplishing something for yourself and not for others. It’s about going out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself. Or even making excuses not to do it.But hey, today is today and tomorrow will never be today.Life is too short and don’t let this room limit your dreams.— Maycol J. Betanco, Classical High School In Providence, RIGlimpse of a shooting starFrom the day she was born, she could never see the moon. Apart from the stars, and the other giants that riddle the night sky, she could never see the moon. She was born missing part of her lumbar spine, and she couldn’t get out of her bed for that reason. Her home had no windows and I, as her caretaker, was never allowed to move her bed. There were some nights where I stayed overnight and thought about dragging her outside just so she could catch a glimpse at a shooting star. But, it never happened. Until one day it hit me. When she was already asleep one night, I got up from my post at the couch. I grabbed a saw from her garage and, before she could wake up, started hacking away at the drywall above our heads.— Max Plasotes, Northbrook ILThe universe watching down on meAdvertisementSupported byBy Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Edgar Sandoval[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]In January, a sleeping rider was stabbed in the head with a screwdriver on New York City’s subway. A month before that, a police officer fended off five homeless men who attacked him on a train platform. And on Sunday afternoon, a man was fatally shot at a subway station in Queens, the first recorded murder on the system in six months.The subway has come a long way since the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s when violence was rampant and riders felt constant dread. The system has become very safe, with just one murder on the subway last year compared with 26 in 1990.But lately, riders are starting to feel less safe on the subway, a belief that is often reinforced by a flood of complaints about the transit system, doled out in real time on social media.The shooting in Queens on Sunday was captured on Twitter in a graphic video showing a struggle between several men who had stepped out of a southbound 7 train at the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue station around 12:45 p.m.At one point in the video, gunshots can be heard offscreen. The police said the two suspects in the shooting had fled on foot. On Monday, the police arrested a 26-year-old man whom they identified as a member of MS-13, a violent street gang with roots in El Salvador, in connection with the killing.“Violent incidents like the one today will not be tolerated on our trains, or anywhere in New York City,” said Phil Walzak, a police spokesman. “The subway system remains incredibly safe, with approximately one crime for every million riders per day.”But data shows crime is heading in the wrong direction: Transit crimes were up 3.8 percent last year, according to the police, part of a slight rise since 2014. Still, there were only about 2,500 major crimes — including murders, rapes and robberies — in the system last year, or about seven per day, compared with nearly 17,500 transit crimes in 1990.Back then, people were afraid to ride the train and often avoided doing so late at night. Some stayed away from the subway altogether. The stabbing of a tourist on the subway in 1990 as he defended his mother during a robbery crystallized fears about crime.Recent concerns about safety have caused subway riders to once again change their behavior. Some do not take the train after a certain hour or allow children and visiting relatives to travel alone. Others switch cars to avoid menacing passengers.Ana Smith, 62, of Brooklyn, said she does not let her 10-year-old grandson ride the subway alone.“I have to be with him,” she said as they waited at a station in Brooklyn on a recent morning. “I have to protect him. It’s too dangerous. We have too much crime in this train station.”The police insist that the subway is safe and that a few notable incidents captured on social media have skewed perceptions that it is not. The transit police chief, Edward Delatorre, said the rise in transit crimes last year was mainly driven by thefts in Manhattan.Mr. Delatorre said in an interview that the number of crimes in the subway is so small, that “one or two recidivist offenders can enter the system and throw the crime numbers out of whack.” Still, he said he was adding more officers to the system as part of a new policing model under Mayor Bill de Blasio.The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, said in a statement: “I want people to know that despite this beyond-horrifying incident which is under active investigation, the subway is remarkably safe, both generally as a public space as well as relative to other modes of transport such as driving.”Subway ridership has exploded over the last quarter century, making it all the more notable that crime has remained low on the system. There were about one billion annual subway trips in 1990, compared with 1.7 billion trips in 2017.But the city’s former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, suggested on Twitter recently that disorder on the subway could signal a return to the conditions that led to soaring crime. On Christmas Day, he posted a video of the officer fighting off the men and said it was a reminder that the city’s descent into violence had begun in the subways. “The quality-of-life declines and warning signs are all there for it to happen once again,” he said.In the 1980s, muggings and violent crime were rife on the subway. The fear was so universal that Bernard Goetz was applauded by some for shooting four teenagers on a train in 1984 after believing he was being robbed. The 1990 killing of the tourist from Utah, Brian Watkins, was particularly jarring: Mr. Watkins was stabbed in the chest after several young men slashed his father’s pants pocket and hit his mother. The incident represented a breaking point for the city that led to an aggressive police crackdown.In 1982, a transit officer described sensing “a big sigh of relief” from passengers when he would step on to a train. “You can actually hear it,” he told The Times. “People smile at me. They’re relieved.”Subway riders today are perhaps most concerned about poor service and constant delays. Subway leaders are also worried about a rise in fare evasion — a problem they say drains more than $200 million in revenue from the system each year.But New Yorkers are increasingly worried about crime, too. In January, four men attacked an 18-year-old woman at a station in the Bronx, punching her and stealing her headphones.Ivan Cruz, 20, an architecture student at New York City College of Technology, said he was often harassed on the subway.“I always try to stick around a group of people to feel safer,” Mr. Cruz said at the Jay Street-MetroTech station, a busy hub in Brooklyn, on a recent afternoon.Mr. Cruz said he was recently approached by an intoxicated passenger and later by a group of teenagers who bullied him. He worries that someone could try to push him, so he avoids the station at night.“I only see a few officers patrolling here,” he said. “I’d feel safer with more.”The only subway murder recorded last year took place in July at the Broadway Junction station in Brooklyn, when a man pulled a woman onto the tracks in a murder-suicide. In another killing in January, a 65-year-old man died after a teenager knocked him on to the tracks at the Jay Street station and he went into cardiac arrest. The teenager was charged with manslaughter.New Yorkers regularly encounter agitated people on the subway who yell and threaten other passengers. The city is struggling to cope with a growing homeless population, many of whom have mental health issues. Some of those people end up in the subway.Chief Delatorre said he does not believe there are more outbursts by people with mental health problems on the subway than in the past.“I believe it’s more noticeable,” he said. “The Wi-Fi is stronger and now anytime anything happens, it’s blasted out right away.”The challenge of policing the subway was highlighted by an altercation in January when transit officers asked two men to leave an entrance after riders complained they were smoking. The men had been arrested at the same station in December for attacking officers.The officers, who were caught on video pummeling the men with their batons, are being investigated for using excessive force. Charges were dropped against one of the men — a move that prompted a rare rebuke from James P. O’Neill, the city’s police commissioner. The decision had put the safety of officers and the public in jeopardy, Mr. O’Neill said on Twitter.The police say the recent uptick in crime was due in part to several international pickpocket rings. Under Mr. de Blasio, the police are using a new approach, known as the neighborhood policing model, on the subway.Chief Delatorre said he is posting more officers on parts of the subway to develop relationships with M.T.A. workers and riders.“The feedback we’re getting is positive,” he said. “They’re seeing more officers on platforms and on the trains.”Cece Colon, a retired legal secretary, fled an F train recently when a confrontation erupted between two women.“It was too much — I got off and got on another train,” Ms. Colon said while waiting at the Jay Street station.Ms. Colon said she avoids carrying expensive items on the subway.“Nothing in my purse is valuable,’’ she said. “I feel more liberated.’’Lora Hinds, 47, an M.T.A. dispatcher, said she avoids wearing jewelry.“I try not to travel at night if I don’t have to,” she said.The Second Avenue station on the F line in Manhattan has become well known for a group of men who harass riders. On a recent afternoon, about eight men sat on the platform drinking and smoking. A high school student said the men yelled racist things at her.Now her boyfriend accompanies her on the subway to make sure she is safe.“When we are together, they don’t bother us,” the teenager said.An earlier version of this story, relying on information from the New York Police Department, referred incorrectly to the one recorded murder that took place on the subway in 2018. It was a murder-suicide in July at the Broadway Junction station in Brooklyn, not an incident in January at the Jay Street station.Ashley Southall contributed reporting.AdvertisementSupported byBy Aurelien BreedenPARIS — At least 10 people were killed and 37 injured after a fast-moving fire that may have been intentionally set coursed through an eight-story building in a residential part of western Paris on Tuesday.The fire, which the authorities were treating as a possible case of arson and which appeared to be tied to a neighborhood dispute, was the deadliest in the French capital in over a decade.Footage from the scene provided by the Paris Fire Department to French television showed flames bursting through the upper windows of the building and black smoke swirling around the courtyard, as firefighters climbed up ladders to reach people at their windows. Some were lowered to the ground using harnesses.The police opened a criminal investigation and Rémy Heitz, the Paris prosecutor, told reporters early Tuesday that a 40-year-old woman who lived in the building, on Rue Erlanger, in the 16th Arrondissement, had been taken into custody nearby.“This person was arrested overnight, not far from the scene, not far from the fire,” Mr. Heitz said. He said that the woman had a history of mental health issues but did not provide more details about her identity or the reasons for her arrest.The fire was the deadliest in Paris since 2005, when 24 people, including 11 children, were killed in a hotel near the Paris Opera, a tragedy that was the worst of its kind since World War II. Later that same year, a fire in a dilapidated apartment building in the 13th Arrondissement killed 17 people. In 2015, eight people died in a fire that tore through an apartment building in the 18th Arrondissement of the capital.Firefighters were called to Rue Erlanger around 1 a.m., according to Capt. Valérian Fuet, a spokesman for the Paris Fire Department, who said over 200 firefighters worked for hours until the blaze was finally put out between 6 and 7 a.m.Captain Fuet said that one person was seriously injured and that eight firefighters were among those who had suffered lighter injuries. About 50 people were evacuated from the building, he said, as were people in neighboring structures who were told to leave as a precaution. Those who had died appeared to have been burned or inhaled the smoke.“When we arrived, the fire had already started on several floors,” Captain Fuet told reporters later Tuesday morning, adding that the blaze had spread very rapidly.He said that the fire had started in a part of the apartment complex that opens onto a courtyard rather than the street, preventing the firefighters from using mechanical ladders from their trucks, and forcing them instead to use hand ladders to help residents escape.Firefighters were still searching for survivors and assessing damage, including a potential risk that the seventh and eighth floors might collapse, Captain Fuet said.Pierre-Alexandre Vézinet, a 30-year-old mobile app developer who lives on a street perpendicular to Rue Erlanger, said that he heard a siren shortly after going to bed shortly after midnight, but initially thought it was nothing to be concerned about.“Police go by almost every night, so I didn’t worry,” he said in a telephone interview. “Several minutes later I heard another one. Then another, and yet another.”Mr. Vézinet saw emergency service vehicles crowd the street, and later that morning he saw residents of the building that had caught fire.“I saw two women who were covered in a foil blanket, with a firefighter,” he said. “They were covered in soot, you could tell they had just left the building.”Julien Denormandie, the French minister in charge of housing, told reporters at the scene that the building was about 50 years old and was not known to be at risk.President Emmanuel Macron said in a message on Twitter that his thoughts were with the victims of the fire, and he thanked the firefighters “whose bravery made it possible to save many lives.”The fire on Tuesday came several weeks after a powerful explosion tore through a bakery in the 9th Arrondissement, killing four people, including two firefighters, and wounding more than 60. The authorities believe that blast was caused by a gas leak, and an investigation is underway.AdvertisementSupported byBy Ashley SouthallThree people on a carjacking spree drove a stolen car to a Bronx courthouse on Monday so that one of them could make an appearance in court in regards to a different crime, the police said.That decision led to wild confrontation on a bustling avenue in the borough’s court district during which a police officer, who was nearly crushed, shot the driver of the stolen car, the police said.The sequence of events began when police license-plate readers detected a car in the area that had been reported stolen. A 24-year-old officer, whom police did not identify, spotted the car and approached it when she saw three people climb inside, Terence A. Monahan, the police chief of department, told reporters at the scene.But upon seeing the officer, the driver slammed into reverse, pinning the officer against a parked car across from the entrance to the Bronx County Family Court building. She fired three rounds into the car, striking the driver in the chest and left torso, Chief Monahan said.The officer was being treated for injuries to her hip and leg at an area hospital, the police said. The driver underwent surgery for her wounds at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where she was in critical condition, according to the police. Two passengers in the stolen car were arrested.The police did not release their names and charges against them, and an official at the scene said they appeared to be teenagers.Chief Monahan said the wounded driver, the two passengers and a fourth man who remained at large were involved in a robbery and carjacking spree that began early Sunday in the Bronx and traversed Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.The foursome — two young women and two young men — stole two cars and robbed three people of purses and cellphones, he said.They had ditched the first car after crashing it in Brooklyn on Sunday and then stole a charcoal-colored Hyundai Sonata, whose owner had reported it missing that same day, Chief Monahan said.It was the Sonata that three of the youths rode on Monday morning to Sheridan Avenue and 162nd Street, where one had to answer a charge in Bronx Criminal Court, the police said.What they did not know is that police license-plate readers had tracked the car to the spot where it was parked, Chief Monahan said. After the court appearance, the three returned to the car and were about to drive away when the officer and her partner approached, the chief said.The wild scene unfolded along Sheridan Avenue around 11:30 a.m., as dozens of people were going in and out of the area courts, restaurants and law offices.Nathaliz Martínez, a legal secretary at the Goodfriend Document Center across from the family court entrance, said she heard the gunshots from the second-floor office and tried to convince herself it was just a car backfiring.“It wasn’t even afternoon yet,” she said incredulously. “Are you serious?”A man who did not want to be identified because he was on parole said he was coming out of the Social Security office a block away when he saw the officer spin around before hearing three shots. Within minutes, police helicopters were hovering overhead and police officers swarmed the area.Another man, Jason Rogers, 32, said he was coming out of the Bronx Criminal Court next door on East 161st Street when he heard the shots, ducked and peered around.“I was trying to look for the shooter,” Mr. Rogers said. “It was a rush.”Jose Sánchez, 30, had just passed through the scanners in the Family Court when he heard a female officer yelling, “Sir, this is not an exit!” Moments later, he heard gunshots.“It was loud enough that everybody scattered,” he said. “There were kids outside and the officers brought them inside.”Dozens of police and court officers cordoned off streets near the scene. High-ranking police officials — the first deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and the chief of patrol — huddled with investigators surrounding the stolen sedan. A Nike bag sat on the ground nearby and nine evidence markers surrounded the car.Officials said the officer and her partner were wearing body cameras, but they were not turned on before the shooting unfolded. Still, investigators recovered video of the incident from nearby buildings, the police said.Follow Ashley Southall on Twitter: @AshleyAtTimesAdvertisementSupported byHelp DeskBy Judith NewmanHow did I know my anxiety had gotten the better of me? When I found myself taking meticulous notes on a forthcoming book by Erica Feldmann called HAUSMAGICK: Transform Your Home With Witchcraft (HarperOne, $25.99, available in March). The year 2018 hadn’t been so great, what with the death of a husband and, possibly, a republic. Maybe 2019 would be better if I bought certain purifying elements for my home. The right crystals, sage sticks and — salt? Apparently, you can sprinkle salt around the house after a person with “toxic energy” visits. Attention future dates: If you see me reaching for the shaker as you’re leaving, you know things haven’t gone well.If my nerves are frayed, I take cold comfort in knowing I’m not alone. Whether it’s our political situation, the jangling distractions of everyday life or the not-irrational sense that mankind’s need to find another planet isn’t just a sci-fi plotline, we seem to be in the midst of one massive freakout. Kierkegaard argued that anxiety stemmed from the “dizziness of freedom,” the paralysis that comes from infinite choice and possibility. That was in 1844. Imagine what he would have thought about today.But here’s some good news: If we’re all a little tense, well, there’s a book for that. Many books, actually. Several of the ones I consulted were so wrongheaded or incomprehensible they made me more nervous. (“Motivation is a Unicorn Fart” almost made me hurl in a glittery rainbow arc.) Here are three that worked.Recently a friend told me that he had reached what he calls his vidpoint: the moment you realize you have more movie hours stored on your DVR than you have hours left to live. I thought about that friend while reading Matt Haig’s NOTES ON A NERVOUS PLANET (Penguin, paper, $16), a follow-up to his previous book “Reasons to Stay Alive,” which chronicled his struggles with anxiety and depression. The core of first-world malaise, he argues, can be summed up by something T. S. Eliot observed in “Four Quartets”: We are “distracted from distraction by distraction.” Here, in clever chapterettes and listicles (he seems to assume we’re all too jumpy to read more than a few pages at a time), Haig muses about our anxieties: our fears of aging, of not being rich, of not being beautiful or successful enough. All while being massive consumers of everything. What really sells, he says, is not so much sex as fear. Every day, every minute, we’re deluged with images of people who are prettier, richer and having more fun than we are. And then there’s the bombardment of news, which is presented in a way to provide “more food for our nightmares.” Which is why we must take time to simply turn it all off and go outside. (I’m going to do this just as soon as the Mueller report is delivered.) This isn’t exactly a novel concept, and Haig mentions but doesn’t explore the science of, say, why staring at the sky or simply being out in nature helps our mental health. But he does have some memorable ways of telling us about it. (“Hello. I am the beach. … I have been around for millions of years. I was around at the dawn of life itself. And I have to tell you something. … I am entirely indifferent to your body mass index. … I am oblivious.”) And he has one terrific piece of advice that I’m thinking of sewing on a pillow sampler and giving to my teenage sons: “Never be cool. Never try to be cool. Never worry what the cool people think. Head for the warm people. Life is warmth. You’ll be cool when you’re dead.”I can’t help noting, however, that the last time I checked Haig’s Twitter feed he had posted seven times in two hours. Maybe he’s still trying.“Anxiety” is a mild term for what can be a severe mental illness. In fact, anxiety disorders of various degrees are among the most common mental illnesses in America, affecting more than one in five adults. In HOW NOT TO FALL APART: Lessons Learned on the Road From Self-Harm to Self-Care (TarcherPerigee, paper, $16), Maggy Van Eijk starts with a hopeful message: You can have any number of mental health issues and still learn to cope. Van Eijk, who’s now the BBC’s social media editor, has a history of severe anxiety as well as borderline personality disorder; her arms are scarred from years of cutting. She’s also really funny. Here’s a partial list of what one of her bad anxiety days can look like: “Waking up in the middle of the night to remember that thing I said five years ago was a bit rude. Time to linger on that memory until sunrise! … Having a bath to try to relax but then remembering the bath is basically an open coffin filled with my own liquid filth. … Seeing a pile of clothes in the dark and thinking it looks like a massive panther, then thinking … ‘What if it is a panther?’”Van Eijk’s book is organized around life challenges, and what to remember if they happen to You, Person With Mental Illness. Her explanation of self-harm is particularly touching and helped me to understand why a person might do it. Among the reasons she hasn’t done it, she writes, is that “I’ve been listening to My Chemical Romance all day.” Rather, it’s about the anger that “refuses to leave my body” if she’s upset or about the feeling that “my voice isn’t being heard and it has nowhere to go.” This is a woman who, after a breakup, had to go to a burn unit after repeatedly putting out a cigarette on her arm, so one tends to listen to her about the distraction/substitution methods she uses to stop hurting herself. And her reasons for doing things as mundane as making lists turn out not to be mundane at all. “Lists,” she reminds us, “are a direct link to the future.” And if you’re someone who has thoughts about having no future, she says, they can at least temporarily steer you away from a terrible decision.If I had a self-destructive young adult in my life, someone in real pain, this is probably the book I’d get her.Like many who have experienced recent loss, I tend to bolt upright at 3 in the morning, heart pounding, with one overarching thought: “What now?”  Which is why I found Claire Bidwell Smith’s ANXIETY: The Missing Stage of Grief (Lifelong/Da Capo, $26) both soothing and informative. Smith was 14 and an only child when both of her parents got cancer. If that’s not enough of a breeding ground for a lifetime of anxiety attacks, I don’t know what is.The experience of both parents dying when she was young propelled Smith into hospice work and grief therapy. “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear,” C. S. Lewis wrote in “A Grief Observed,” and Smith understands this observation on the deepest personal level. She goes over techniques for dealing with anxiety, whatever its source. Maybe it’s about the guilt you feel when recalling the decisions you’ve made for a dying loved one; maybe it’s about your loneliness; or maybe, as is often the case in full-blown panic attacks, it’s because you’re convinced that you’re next. Smith’s words are particularly useful for panic attack sufferers. Once you know that you’re not, indeed, dying, she shows you how you can normalize your panic, and how you can look at these episodes with curiosity, not terror. It’s also useful to be reminded that American society isn’t one that honors grief. In many other cultures, she explains, quoting a colleague, you have “six or 12 months of a grieving period where the world doesn’t expect much of you.” Someone give me that one-year-free pass, please.Certainly reading a book or three may not be the answer, and none of these books emphasize, or even discuss, medication as a possible aid. My own thoughts about dealing with severe anxiety? Start with your doctor. And then, for life’s more modest challenges, there’s always my new go-to: A DRINKABLE FEAST: A Cocktail Companion to 1920s Paris (TarcherPerigee, $18), by Philip Greene. I have yet to try a Monkey Gland or a Scoff-Law cocktail, but am infinitely calmer after three glasses of vin blanc cassis — and pleased to know it was a Henry Miller favorite.

Her son was struck in the face by the officer’s gunfire.Almost exactly a year ago, a jury found that the first shot the officer had fired at Ms. Gaines was not reasonable and awarded damages on the grounds that the police had violated the Gaineses’ civil rights and had committed battery on the mother and son.But the decision on Thursday by the judge, Mickey J. Norman of Baltimore County Circuit Court, determined that the police officer who shot Ms. Gaines, Royce Ruby, was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal protection used to defend government officials from civil liability while they are acting in an official capacity. Critics of the doctrine have argued that it has denied justice to victims of abuse, especially when it is used in police shooting cases.In deciding that the protection applied to Officer Ruby, who is now a corporal, Judge Norman determined that the officer did not violate Ms. Gaines’s civil rights, as the family claimed.In his 78-page decision, Judge Norman wrote that in evaluating whether Officer Ruby used excessive force, “the facts must be examined from the perspective of the officer.” The judge noted that Ms. Gaines did not surrender to the police or put a shotgun down and that, six hours into the standoff, Ms. Gaines moved from the living room to behind a wall in the kitchen, a position that Officer Ruby said was a “tactical advantage.”In February 2018, an all-female jury awarded Kodi Gaines more than $32.8 million; Karsyn Courtney, Kodi’s younger sister, who was not in the apartment at the time of the shooting, was awarded more than $4.5 million; and Korryn’s mother and father were awarded $300,000 each, as was the estate of Korryn Gaines.Kenneth Ravenell, a lawyer representing Kodi, said in an email that he planned to appeal the decision. Mr. Ravenell called the judge’s opinion “factually wrong and legally flawed in many respects,” but would not elaborate. The family had not yet collected the money because of Baltimore County’s appeal of the jury’s decision.A spokesman for the Baltimore County executive’s office declined to comment.The police standoff started in Randallstown on Aug 1., 2016, when officers tried to serve Ms. Gaines with an arrest warrant after they said she had failed to appear in court on charges related to a traffic stop. The police were also serving an arrest warrant on her boyfriend, Kareem Courtney, 39, who the police said was wanted on an assault charge.According to the sequence of events laid out in the judge’s decision, when county police officers encountered Ms. Gaines on the floor of her living room with a shotgun, they called in a SWAT unit and hostage negotiators. The judge wrote that the police understood that Ms. Gaines might have had mental health issues.Officer Ruby testified during the trial that he saw Ms. Gaines raise her shotgun at the officers. He said that after he fired the first shot at Ms. Gaines, her shotgun discharged twice. He testified that he opened fire at her a second time because he believed she was going to shoot again.Mr. Ravenell said last year that Officer Ruby fired his first shot from outside the apartment knowing that Kodi Gaines, the 5-year-old, was in the kitchen with his mother but without being able to see him. The family’s legal team disputes that Ms. Gaines raised her shotgun at the officers and, according to the judge’s decision, has argued that the law enforcement officials were sheltered from harm behind a brick wall and their protective gear.In his decision, Judge Norman determined that the officer “cannot be expected to coolly engage in a protracted analysis of all the information known to him in a rapidly changing circumstance, putting the officer in the position of having to make an immediate choice.”The judge also dismissed the claim that Officer Ruby committed battery against Kodi Gaines because it was not his intention to shoot the young boy. He wrote that a bullet fragment from the officer’s first shot struck Kodi’s cheek, but did not penetrate it.Follow Julia Jacobs on Twitter: @juliarebeccaj.AdvertisementSupported bynotedDon’t worry, the colleague you’ve never met isn’t trying to kiss you over email.By Jessica SchifferValentine’s Day is over, but we’re still receiving an endless stream of kisses: passed along in emails and texts like months-old mints nestled at the bottom of our bags, doled out inconsequentially to our tax guys and the work colleagues we’ve never actually met.Symbolized by two lowercase X’s or a lone capital at the close of a message, kisses have become the trivial signoff du jour for a subset of Americans, a spicier take on “All best.” Hugs, their more sober partner, written simply as “o,” have been kicked aside after failing to make it big in the merciless world of internet parlance.Ending digital notes with these shorthand kisses is especially popular today among people who work in industries like fashion or public relations, which lean female and are, perhaps, less likely to be navigating the muddy waters of #MeToo. The x’s manufacture closeness and soften bad news. To leave them out is to risk coming across wooden and cold, if not a psychopath.Dana Schwartz, the co-founder of the Hours Agency, a fashion public relations firm in New York, has long been a proponent of signing work-related emails with “xx,” finding that it makes the messages more friendly and conversational. In the last few years, she’s noticed more and more people in her orbit using “xx,” too.“Email itself has changed, with shorter and less-structured notes back and forth becoming more common,” Ms. Schwartz said. “This has allowed quick expressions like ‘xx’ to gain popularity and take on new meaning,” more gratitude than romance.But how did we land here? Sending virtual kisses to people with whom we’d never really want to lock lips?Apparently, we have the Brits to thank (or blame, depending on your viewpoint).The author Ben Yagoda, who tracks Britishisms entering the American lexicon on his blog Not One-Off Britishisms, first noticed the trend trickling over to the States in 2011. According to his then-college-age daughter Maria, all of her friends who had studied abroad in England were suddenly using “xx” in their digital messages in an effort to sound more British and, thus, cooler.By 2014, the trend had grown significant enough in Britain to warrant a study on its popularity. Lynne Cahill, the head of English language and linguistics at the University of Sussex surveyed roughly 600 people (90 percent of whom lived in the U.K.) aged 15 to 71 and found that 95 percent of them used “xx” in text messages, emails and instant messages.British people have used kisses to sign off their letters and greeting cards as far back as 1763, according to Ms. Cahill. Winston Churchill was an early proponent, closing one letter he sent in 1894 with: “Please excuse bad writing as I am in an awful hurry. (Many kisses.) xxx WSC.”Why the letter X, long a way illiterate people signed their letters, was picked to represent kisses is unclear — some linguists believe it was because its pronunciation sounds similar to the word “kiss” — but it spread quickly to adjacent countries and former colonies like Australia.Mark Liberman, a professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, said he has received “bises,” which French-English dictionaries translate to “x” or “xx,” from some of his closer French colleagues since at least the 1980s.“It’s been a thing my whole life,” said Alice Bugeja, a fourth-year student at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She grew up in Chichester, in Southeast England, but spent a few years as a child living in Ohio. “When I lived in America and sent messages to my friends, it came off as really unfriendly that they didn’t respond with an ‘x,’” she said.But it’s Americans, of course, who have taken x’s to the nth degree, and are now using them in the workplace and even with unlikely recipients like their doctors or lawyers.Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist who is writing a book on internet language, has received emails from strangers seeking career advice that feature the once intimate signoff. She attributes its unexpected usage to our sheer boredom with the other options on offer: “Best” sounds robotic, and “Thanks” isn’t always relevant.Known as phatic expressions, these closing niceties are used more for their social function than their literal meaning, Ms. McCulloch said, like asking someone “How are you?” because it’s the polite thing to do, not because you’re interested in a detailed breakdown of their mental health.AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert PearWASHINGTON — Just two days after a federal court struck down work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries in Arkansas and Kentucky, the Trump administration approved similar requirements in Utah on Friday.The administration acknowledged that some Utah residents might lose coverage, but said that others would become healthier and gain financial independence because they were working.In approving a Medicaid waiver for Utah, the Trump administration is reaffirming its conservative priorities, defying critics and inviting another round of litigation.Under the new Utah program, 70,000 to 90,000 adults will become eligible for Medicaid, and they can begin applying for coverage on Monday. The waiver has a novel feature to control costs: Utah can freeze enrollment of newly eligible beneficiaries if the projected costs of their coverage exceed the funds appropriated by the State Legislature.Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who approved the waiver, said that Utah had found a “fiscally sustainable” way to cover more people.Utah voters in November approved a full expansion of Medicaid as envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, to cover people with annual incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level — up to about $17,235 for an individual. But state legislators had different ideas and approved a more limited expansion, to 100 percent of the poverty level, or $12,490 for an individual, with work requirements. That is the program approved on Friday.In her approval letter, Ms. Verma said the work requirements could help people achieve financial independence and obtain jobs providing health insurance.“If participating in community engagement activities improves beneficiaries’ physical and mental health,” Ms. Verma wrote, “these beneficiaries may consume fewer health care resources, thus keeping in check state costs on Medicaid.”“Some beneficiaries could lose coverage, at least temporarily, for failure to comply” with the work requirements, Ms. Verma said.But she said the Utah program had safeguards, including exemptions from the work requirements for certain people who were disabled, caring for children under the age of 6 or being treated for drug addiction.Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement program, meaning that benefits are generally available to anyone who meets eligibility criteria established by the federal and state governments.Ms. Verma defended the enrollment limits as a way for Utah to keep within its budget, so it would not have to cut benefits.Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican, welcomed approval of the state program, describing it as “an important first step in covering vulnerable Utahans in a financially sustainable way.”But Joan C. Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said: “Utah’s enrollment cap is in direct conflict with Medicaid’s guarantee of coverage if you meet the income eligibility requirements. As a legal matter, it is even more questionable than the waivers struck down in Arkansas and Kentucky.”Ms. Verma approved the Utah waiver in an 8,500-word letter that repeats many of the points rejected on Wednesday in the Arkansas and Kentucky cases by Judge James E. Boasberg of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.Utah’s demonstration project promotes the health of beneficiaries and their financial independence, Ms. Verma said. Research shows a positive link between employment and “improved health outcomes,” she wrote.Judge Boasberg said that the waivers in Arkansas and Kentucky could not be justified as contributing to either the financial independence of Medicaid beneficiaries or the “fiscal sustainability” of the program for a state. Those, he said, are not independent objectives of the federal Medicaid law, and waivers are supposed to promote those objectives.The court rulings on Arkansas and Kentucky are not binding on federal officials as they consider proposals from other states. Federal officials can try to argue that the work requirements in Utah are somewhat different from those in Arkansas and Kentucky.Matthew Slonaker, the executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a nonprofit group that supported the full expansion of Medicaid, said, “The work requirements here are legally vulnerable, just like those in Arkansas and Kentucky.”The changes in Utah approved on Friday fall short of the expansion of Medicaid envisioned in the Affordable Care Act and endorsed by Utah voters in November.But Utah is liberalizing its current eligibility criteria. Many poor people in Utah have been ineligible for Medicaid if they do not have dependent children. The state Medicaid program has covered parents with incomes up to 60 percent of the poverty level, or about $7,500 for an individual. Utah has also extended coverage to about 3,000 adults with income below 5 percent of the poverty level, about $625 a year.“As a condition of eligibility” in Utah, beneficiaries covered under the waiver will have to register for work through the state’s online system. They will have to complete an online assessment of their job training needs and an online training program. In addition, they will have to apply for jobs with at least 48 potential employers.AdvertisementSupported byBy Maggie AstorSingle-issue voters are common enough. Single-issue candidates are unicorns.This hasn’t deterred Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who entered the presidential race on Friday on a bold bet: that a singular focus on combating climate change can distinguish him in one of the largest Democratic fields ever.Just spitballing here, but perhaps saving people and the planet from climate catastrophe, and creating millions of jobs doing it, should be THE top issue. 2020 must be a referendum on climate action. https://t.co/OGXiUF8GftHere is a look at what Mr. Inslee wants to do about the climate, as well as other significant issues, even if he doesn’t emphasize them in his campaign.Projections on the effects of climate change are increasingly dire, and Mr. Inslee argues that combating it should take precedence over all else — though he rejects the premise that it can be neatly separated from other issues to begin with. Extreme weather has exacerbated refugee crises and fueled immigration, for instance. Heat waves and poor air quality affect health.Mr. Inslee has praised the Green New Deal — a sweeping proposal by some Democrats in Congress that, among many other environmental and economic goals, calls for a fully renewable energy supply within 10 years — for elevating public discussion of climate change and acknowledging the scale of the action needed. But he has also described it as more of an “aspirational” outline of principles than a policy document.His environmental policy record in his home state is long. In 2015, he ordered Washington’s Department of Ecology to impose a cap on carbon emissions. He created a fund for clean energy, and the state now has extensive solar energy infrastructure and electric buses. While economic damage is a concern for opponents of limiting fossil fuels, Washington had the highest G.D.P. growth in the nation in 2018, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.Mr. Inslee also tried unsuccessfully last year to get the Washington Legislature to vote on a carbon tax, which would have been the first in the nation; voters rejected the proposal in November. He then proposed a different series of actions, including running the state’s electric utilities fully on renewable power by 2045, requiring buildings to be more energy efficient, promoting electric vehicles and cutting down on hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioners. Hydrofluorocarbon emissions have been growing faster than any other form of greenhouse gas emissions.In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Mr. Inslee called for net-zero carbon emissions nationwide by 2050 — a longer timeline than the Green New Deal’s 10 years, which experts say is unrealistic. (“Net-zero” could mean either eliminating carbon emissions altogether, or reducing them and using offsetting technologies to cancel out the rest.) He also called for a “100 percent clean-energy grid” and “massive investments” to transition buildings, industries and transportation to renewable sources.While Mr. Inslee has made clear that he intends to focus overwhelmingly on climate change, he is on the record supporting liberal policies in many other areas.• He has been outspoken in favor of gun control, and after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., last year, he confronted President Trump on live television, denouncing Mr. Trump’s suggestion to arm schoolteachers. Among other measures, he wants to expand background checks and restrict some semiautomatic weapons. His advocacy on the issue goes back many years; he lost his seat in Congress after voting for the 1994 assault weapons ban.• He supports universal health care in some form and recently proposed a government-funded “public option” on Washington’s insurance exchange, which he cast as the first step toward a universal program.• While he has not released a federal tax proposal, he recently introduced a plan in Washington State that would increase several taxes and institute a 9 percent tax on some capital gains. (The state doesn’t tax capital gains now.) His budget would increase spending by about 20 percent to fund anti-climate-change programs, education and mental health services, and to protect endangered orcas.• He backed legislation to increase Washington’s minimum wage from $9.47 an hour to $12. Voters approved that increase in 2016, and it has been phased in gradually.• He supports legalizing marijuana and announced a program in January that will pardon some Washington residents previously convicted of marijuana possession.• He opposes the death penalty as currently administered and suspended executions in Washington in 2014, saying the risk of wrongful convictions was unacceptable. “There are too many flaws in the system,” he said at the time, “and when the ultimate decision is death, there is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system.”Follow Maggie Astor on Twitter: @MaggieAstor.AdvertisementSupported byBy Sopan DebA special visitor showed up several days ago at 930 East 50th Street, a former synagogue now known in Chicago and beyond as the headquarters of Rainbow/Push, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson’s civil rights organization.Over two days, Saturday and Monday, the visitor, the “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, spoke with high school students who were thinking about college. He hawked civil rights gear at the upstairs bookstore. He gave tips to the social media, television production and marketing staffs. He promised to keep in touch.The staff was “grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented and humble personality,” Mr. Jackson wrote in a letter.For Mr. Smollett, the visit may have been an opportunity as well.In explaining their decision to drop all charges on Tuesday against Mr. Smollett, who had been accused of faking a hate crime attack, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office noted that Mr. Smollett had no history of violent crime or other felonies, his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond payment and his “volunteer service in the community.”[A timeline of events of the Smollett case.]The statement raised several questions, including whether the community service was part of a deal to end the case (a prosecutor said it was; Smollett’s lawyers said there had been no quid pro quo). It also left many wondering: just what service had Smollett done?A batch of letters and memos from various organizations, released by the state’s attorney’s office, provided some answers.They mentioned performances that Mr. Smollett, who is also a singer, had done at the national conference of the Kennedy Forum, an organization run by the former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy that focuses on mental health; appearances at the Catalyst Circle Rock School, a predominantly black charter school in Chicago; and work with the City Lights Orchestra, the Boys & Girls Club, and the Black AIDS Institute, whose chief executive wrote that he had “never worked with anyone who was more willing than Jussie to spend his talent, time and money to help other people.”And on Saturday, as his legal team was finalizing talks with prosecutors about dropping the case, Mr. Smollett turned up at Rainbow/Push.According to Mr. Jackson’s letter, Mr. Smollett spent several hours with students who wanted to join the organization’s annual tour of historically black colleges. He spoke with them about the importance of discipline and a good attitude, and answered questions about the music and film industries.[Read more on the case: A bizarre narrative with Chicago as the backdrop.]At the store, which sells books, clothing and memorabilia about civil rights, he spent time “encouraging visitors to purchase Push gear” and offered tips on how the store could market its products to a younger demographic, Mr. Jackson wrote.Mr. Smollett gave advice on production techniques and social media outreach to the staff that creates a weekly broadcast on the Impact television network, and he gave additional advice to the Rainbow/Push membership team.He said he was interested in a long-term relationship with Rainbow/Push, including building a choir for the broadcast. “He has been of tremendous value to our staff and our work,” Mr. Jackson wrote.Mr. Smollett, who is black and gay, had been accused of falsifying a hate crime to get attention in a bid for a higher salary from “Empire.” Mr. Smollett maintains his innocence, saying he had not planned the attack that he reported to the police on Jan. 29. Prosecutors said their decision did not exonerate him, but that the circumstances of the case, as well as the $10,000 payment and the community service, justified the dropping of the charges.Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose police department spent many hours on the case, called the decision a “whitewash of justice,” and other critics seized on their belief that prosecutors had let Mr. Smollett off with just two days of service.“You let him work off ‘community service’ with a couple of days doing odd jobs at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,” wrote John Kass, a Chicago Tribune columnist, adding that he hoped that Mr. Smollett had “sold a few Jesse Jackson action figures.”The Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell wrote, “Does Smollett deserve special consideration because he is an actor and because he has done community service in the past?”In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Smollett, who has a history of social activism, had volunteered with Rainbow/Push in the past. “He became more intensely involved this weekend,” Mr. Jackson said.He compared Mr. Smollett to Johnnie Lee Savory, who had been convicted of murdering two teenagers in Peoria and spent nearly 30 years in prison. He denied killing the pair, and two witnesses recanted their testimony. He was eventually pardoned, and is now a member of Rainbow/Push.As for the mayor’s outrage, Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Emanuel had shown “far less intensity” over the killing of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, by a Chicago police officer who had shot him 16 times. The officer was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison.In a separate interview, Tina Glandian, one of Mr. Smollett’s lawyers, disputed the notion that he had escaped prosecution by helping out with Mr. Jackson’s group.“It was not compulsory whatsoever,” Ms. Glandian said. “Him volunteering for the Push Coalition is completely in line with his years of service.”Robert Chiarito contributed reporting.AdvertisementSupported byBy Catie EdmondsonWASHINGTON — The House this week is set to pass the first major gun control legislation in over two decades, with Democratic lawmakers expected to approve two measures strengthening background checks for all firearms sales.The last time the House put high-profile legislation expanding gun control laws to a vote was in 1994, when it passed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and made it illegal to manufacture a number of semiautomatic weapons for civilian use. That legislation expired after a decade and was not renewed by a Republican-controlled Congress.But riding a new wave of urgency after a series of mass shootings — and the activism inspired by the school massacre in Parkland, Fla., last February in which 17 students and teachers were killed — House Democrats have pledged to take meaningful action on the issue, beginning with the twin bills.Here’s what you need to know about the measures and their odds in the Senate.The Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which the House will take up on Wednesday, requires universal background checks, closing a loophole for buyers at gun shows and online. The legislation, sponsored by Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, also prohibits firearms transfers by a person who is not a licensed dealer. There are a number of exceptions, though, such as a family member giving a firearm as a gift, or lending a gun to someone in imminent danger.The second piece of legislation, the Enhanced Background Checks Act, will be voted on Thursday. Sponsored by Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip, the bill seeks to extend the initial background check review period to 10 days from three.Under federal law, the F.B.I. has three business days to perform its review and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to deny a purchase. If it is unable to do so, on the fourth day, the customer can return to the dealer and buy a gun. That loophole allowed Dylann S. Roof, the man who killed nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, to purchase a .45-caliber handgun even though he had previously admitted to drug possession, which should have barred him from legally obtaining the weapon.A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings — including those in Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Las Vegas — were bought legally and after the gunman passed a federal background check. At least nine attackers had criminal histories or documented mental health problems that did not prevent them from obtaining their weapons.“The new gun control restrictions currently being considered by the Democratic majority in H.R. 8 would not have prevented my shooting,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, said of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. Mr. Scalise was gravely wounded in 2017 when a gunman fired on members of the Republican congressional baseball team while they were practicing in Virginia.But gun control advocates have praised the measures as a meaningful step toward change, and described the legislation as a necessary foundation for future work. Last year, the existing background check system identified and denied 88,000 gun sales to prohibited buyers including criminals and domestic abusers, according to Mr. Thompson’s office — but those same people are currently able to make purchases at gun shows or online.“We have fairly weak gun laws and we have loopholes that make it easy to have the levels of gun violence that we have right now, and we certainly have to do more to address it,” said Robin Lloyd, the managing director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “But it is a critical first step.”The bills introduced by House Democrats closely mirror the last major attempt in the Senate to pass a gun control measure. Efforts led by Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, to require background checks at gun shows and online failed in the Democratic-led Senate in 2013 and again in the Republican-led Senate in 2015.Otherwise, in the last two decades, most firearms legislation taken up by Congress has aimed to relax gun laws, such as attempts in the House and Senate to pass a concealed-carry reciprocity law allowing a person permitted to carry a concealed weapon in one state to carry it in every state.AdvertisementSupported byWe need to pay more attention to the way our culture abuses and isolates new mothers. By Elisa Albert and Jennifer BlockMs. Albert is a novelist and a doula. Ms. Block writes frequently about women’s health. The Food and Drug Administration last week approved the first-ever drug specifically for postpartum depression. The drug, Zulresso, a synthetic form of a hormone produced in the brain, acts quickly, and its effects can last for a month, but there’s a catch. Until a pill version is approved, the patient has to be hospitalized for 60 hours and receive the drug by IV. She can’t be home with her new baby because the drug may cause dizziness and unconsciousness. The price is also dizzying: $34,000 per treatment.Zulresso showed enough promise in clinical trials to warrant speedy review and approval, but there was also a powerful placebo effect: While the depression scores of severely depressed women who received the drug dropped by two-thirds on average in one of the trials, the scores of those who got a sham treatment were cut in half. A big placebo effect is common in antidepressant studies, but it should not be overlooked, because it may be emblematic of one of the root causes of our postpartum despair epidemic. What new mother wouldn’t have an improved outlook after three days of TLC?Postpartum depression is a serious problem, affecting, by some estimates, one in nine American mothers. It can be incredibly painful and is believed to be a growing cause of maternal deaths in the year following a birth. Insurers are expected to cover the exorbitant cost of Zulresso, which suggests that there’s finally a will to address our country’s dismal record on maternal health. Hurray!But if we really want to tackle postpartum depression, we need more than a drug.Research has shown that postpartum depression is more common in countries with high income inequality, high rates of maternal and infant mortality, and a work-life balance skewed toward work. (Hello, America.)The clinical definition of postpartum depression is a “medical complication of childbirth,” but this doesn’t take into account women’s emotional lives, and the fact that the way our culture treats some new mothers amounts to abuse. Pregnant women are often pickled in horror stories about birth, then subjected to unnecessarily intrusive care. Many suffer pelvic trauma; one in three wind up with major abdominal surgery. Then they are sent home with a newborn, typically without support. According to 2015 data, a quarter of women return to work in two weeks. Everyone says that “breast is best,” but new mothers get a decent place to pump at work only if they’re lucky. Most won’t see their doctor again for six weeks. No wonder depression is so common. As one mother we know who plans to quit her job (because she can afford to) said about the lack of parental support in this country: “It’s just so mean.”A new expensive drug is not enough; we need humane, evidence-based maternity care, respect for the “fourth trimester,” months if not years of paid parental leave, and affordable child care.It’s worth pointing out that the Zulresso study was small, involving 247 women, and that the drug maker was involved in its design and interpretation. Some of the participants were also on other antidepressants, which take much longer to kick in. And according to the lead physician on the study, Zulresso may work by “dampening neural activity,” which has startling echoes. More research is needed before we can be sure that this is not just the latest in a long line of drugs offered to women as a quick fix of middling efficacy, with the potential for unexpected side effects. We’d be foolish to believe that any drug is the magic fix that will once and for all end the metaphysical conundrum of experiencing fear, sadness, anger and despair during the most vulnerable time of our lives. Furthermore, let’s be real about who will have access to Zulresso: women with very good insurance, the ability to advocate for themselves, and the flexibility to leave home for three days for treatment. As Jennie Joseph, a Florida-based midwife and founder of the nonprofit organization Commonsense Childbirth, pointed out, “If you’re actually needy, in deep postpartum depression,” you’re “not going to be able to get yourself to the hospital. Where are you a few days after having a baby? You’re in your house being ignored.”In an article for the National Women’s Health Network, one of the few watchdog groups that shun industry funding, two researchers wrote that if Zulresso becomes the go-to fix for postpartum depression, “the onus of treatment will remain where it’s always been, on individual mothers — hardly a revolution in postpartum care.”If insurers are willing to throw down tens of thousands of dollars for a mother’s mental health, we can think of some alternatives that might have a better cost-benefit ratio: Six months paid leave. A live-in doula and a private sleep-training coach. Weekly massages and pelvic-floor rehab sessions. Relocation to a commune in the Bahamas.In the meantime, we fear that Zulresso is just a stopgap, and yet another instance of pathologizing a very sane reaction to our very insane culture.We’d love to be wrong. We’d love a quick, effective, accessible treatment for all who suffer the emotional pain that falls under the rubric of postpartum depression. But wouldn’t it be better if fewer women were left to spiral into despair in the first place?Elisa Albert is a doula and the author of the novel “After Birth.” Jennifer Block is the author of the forthcoming “Everything Below the Waist: Why Health Care Needs a Feminist Revolution.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Karen ZraickHow realistic should active-shooter trainings be?Not as lifelike as a drill at an Indiana elementary school in January, according to teachers there, whose union says they were shot with plastic pellets that caused welts, cuts and bruises.The teachers’ experience at Meadowlawn Elementary School in Monticello, Ind., was detailed by a representative from their union in testimony before state legislators this week. The union was promoting a provision that would bar trainers from shooting school staff members or students with any kind of projectile during safety drills.During the active-shooter drill, “four teachers at a time were taken into a room, told to crouch down and were shot execution style with some sort of projectiles — resulting in injuries to the extent that welts appeared, and blood was drawn,” the union, the Indiana State Teachers Association, wrote on Twitter during the hearing.“The teachers were terrified, but were told not to tell anyone what happened,” the union said. “Teachers waiting outside that heard the screaming were brought into the room four at a time and the shooting process was repeated.”The teachers have not been publicly identified, and none have spoken on the record about their experience.One teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said trainers fired pellet guns at the teachers during several training exercises, not just the execution-style shooting. But in other exercises “you were allowed to try to not get hit,” she said in a phone interview on Friday.She said the teachers were not told they were going to be shot before the execution-style shooting exercise began, and the trainers did not ask the teachers about their medical histories before subjecting them to physical force.“It hurt really bad,” said the woman, who said she was left with bruises, welts and bleeding cuts that took almost two weeks to heal. “You don’t know who you are shooting and what types of experience those individuals had in the past, whether they had PTSD or anything else. And we didn’t know what we were going into.”She described the training as frightening, painful and insulting.“What makes it more outrageous is they thought we would need to have that experience of being shot to take this seriously,” she said. “When I thought about it that way, I really started to get angry. Like we are not professionals. It felt belittling.”Dan Holub, the executive director of the Indiana State Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, said that teachers recognized the need for safety training but that the risks of venturing so far into realism outweighed the benefits.“We need to use common sense — and not use these extreme methods of training,” he said.The provision that the union is pushing for is an amendment to a school safety bill that would require schools to conduct annual active-shooter drills. The bill would also provide schools with funding for school resource officers and mental health services. It has passed the House and is now in the Senate.The author of the House bill, Representative Wendy McNamara, who is also a high school principal, said it was based on the recommendations of a task force authorized by the governor to examine school safety practices after the Parkland, Fla., shooting.She said that she learned of the drill only after her bill passed, but that she would work with colleagues to try to add appropriate language to protect teachers during safety drills.“You can only assume that people would want to be reasonable and put those protections in,” she said. “And if not, then I’ll find a way to make sure that happens.”Mr. Holub, whose organization represents 40,000 educators from kindergarten to 12th grade across the state, said it was the first time he had heard of such injuries during a safety drill. He added that he believed the police officers carrying out the exercise had gone beyond the prescribed curriculum of the training.The White County Sheriff’s Office, which conducted the drill, did not respond to a request for comment. The sheriff, Bill Brooks, told The Indianapolis Star that his officers would not use the pellets during teacher trainings anymore.The Twin Lakes School Corporation, which oversees Meadowlawn and four other schools in or near Monticello, about 90 minutes north of Indianapolis, issued a statement on Thursday about the training.The corporation said that it routinely teamed up with the sheriff’s office to run safety drills, including “ALICE training,” which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate. After teachers voiced concern about the training, the corporation met with them and the sheriff’s office to discuss the matter, the statement said.The ALICE trainings were developed by a private company after the Columbine shooting in 1999 and are now used in schools around the country.ALICE trainings have been criticized at times for their approach, which encourages countering — if there is no way to escape — in order to distract and disrupt a gunman.In a statement, the ALICE Training Institute said that its methods “empower individuals to participate in their own survival in the face of violence.”The statement said that the institute has tens of thousands of certified instructors across the country, and said that local agencies were best positioned to adapt the trainings to an institution or community’s needs.“ALICE training provides proactive response options to increase survivability,” the statement said.While school security has become a huge growth industry, experts caution that there is a scarcity of research about which tactics are most appropriate. Debates have erupted over arming teachers, the usefulness of metal detectors and best practices during unthinkable scenarios.“I’m not sure that one mock example of this would ever prepare anyone for what occurs during a true active-shooting situation,” Mr. Holub said.Liam Stack contributed reporting.AdvertisementSupported byBy Ellen BarryLONDON — Of the various press rituals surrounding the British royal family, few are sillier than the vigil outside a London maternity ward, where squadrons of news reporters wait on the street, sometimes for hours or days, for a woman to go into labor.What follows is bedlam: Bookmakers with blackboards, updating the odds on names, tipsy monarchists, and, for a crowd of exasperated journalists, the opportunity to photograph a few inches of exposed royal baby before the child is whisked away to a palace.The only thing worse, it seems, is not being able to photograph the newborn at all.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, known more widely as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, last week announced that they were canceling the traditional photo opportunity, and that they would instead share their own photos of the newborn, known in the business as “Baby Sussex,” after they had “had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.”This did not go down well with the press, which reported the decision as a departure from more than 40 years’ tradition.The Sun, Britain’s highest-circulation tabloid, chided the couple for infringing on “our royal rights.”“Keeping the nation in the dark over details, even after the birth, is a bad look for the royal couple,” the newspaper’s unsigned leader sniffed on April 12. “The public has a right to know about the lives of those largely funded by their taxes. You can accept that, or be private citizens. Not both.”In interviews, journalists were more raw.“It’s the way Harry is at the moment, he’s just got this bee in his bonnet that all the media are to be ignored,” said Arthur Edwards, 78, a photographer for The Sun, who has covered the births of five babies, including Harry, at the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital.“Harry used to be the best of all of them,” Mr. Edwards say. “We’d get together in a pub and we’d talk about everything, get it off our plate. It would be frank and open, and you never reported it. Now, it’s not even ‘Good morning.’ Nothing. He treats us just like telegraph poles now.”The new couple’s decision to exclude the press from their baby’s birth is hardly a surprise to anyone who has been keeping track. Last year, Harry and Meghan allowed only one reporter inside St. George’s Chapel for their wedding, which came as a crushing blow to publications that were giving the wedding saturation coverage.This coldness toward photographers is understood to come from Prince Harry, who was 12 when his mother was killed in a car crash, as her driver tried to escape paparazzi on motorcycles.The trouble with excluding the press — rewriting the rules of an old, symbiotic relationship — is that the press has a way of getting its own back. By old tradition, coverage of the royals oscillates between sycophantic and brutal, avidly milking story lines about their laziness, profligacy, debauchery or low intelligence. And the ill will of newspaper editors, like the scorned fairy not invited to the princess’s christening in “Sleeping Beauty,” could hover for years around the family.“This is the shattering of a tradition that goes back for decades,” said one senior journalist, who would discuss the matter only on the condition of anonymity. “There is a price to be paid for that, and that price is mockery.”Coverage of the Sussexes, in recent weeks, has not been kind. A Daily Mail columnist last week lampooned Prince Harry for teaming up with Oprah Winfrey for a television series about mental health.“Her homespun brand of half-boiled New Age spirituality, spiked with neoliberal politics and inspirational hokum, plays well with fridge-magnet philosophers like Harry and Meghan,” wrote the columnist, Jan Moir, who went on to pillory the couple, in more earnest tones, for refusing to display the baby to photographers.“While a new baby is a deeply personal and private event, a royal baby is also a totem of national celebration, a beacon of British joy,” she wrote. “What is the point of royals unless we can celebrate their baby royals in a totally bonkers British orgy of bunting, popping corks and knitted bootees? Two or three days later, it just won’t be the same.”Then she went in for the kill. “Perhaps Oprah has snapped up the exclusive first-look baby rights?” she inquired. “I wouldn’t put it past her. Or them.”The beef with the press has taken on a trans-Atlantic tinge, with Ms. Markle’s supporters pushing back in frontal American fashion. In February, five of the Duchess’s friends defended her against “global bullying” in an interview with People Magazine, a move that reportedly surprised her royal handlers. Then, the movie star George Clooney spoke up in her defense, telling a group of journalists that she had been “pursued and vilified and chased in the same way that Diana was and it’s history repeating itself.”This charge rankled even the gentlest of the royal reporters. Valentine Low, who covers the family for The Times of London, derided these allegations as “utter fantasy,” and said many Americans fail to understand the traditional push-and-pull of royal coverage.“The problem is that in some quarters, particularly in the U.S., any negative coverage is seen as racist,” he wrote. “To listen to some U.S. networks is to gain the impression that the British media is racist, sexist, snobbish and determined to gang up on any outsider who has the temerity to join the royal family.”Mr. Edwards, the Sun photographer, was more mournful than angry.“I photographed Harry when he came out in Diana’s arms, and I would like to have photographed him when he came out with his own baby,” he said. “It’s a joyful occasion, with betting companies coming around with names on a board, it’s a rather big event.”He said Prince Harry remained extremely popular with readers.“I feel a bit sad for him,” he said. “Because he’s becoming morose.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Emily S. RuebAbout three months before Scott P. Beierle shot two women to death, injured five other people and killed himself at Hot Yoga Tallahassee in November 2018, the F.B.I. received a tip about him, the Tallahassee Police Department said Tuesday.In August 2018, Mr. Beierle shared a link to his website “Path of Defiance” with a childhood friend and his wife, who was so disturbed by the content — it included songs about the rape and torture of women — that she shared it with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But according to police records, the bureau did not have enough information to pursue the lead.The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The revelation that the bureau had been alerted to Mr. Beierle was among new details released by the Tallahassee Police Department at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon announcing the findings of a three-month investigation. It found that Mr. Beierle had planned the attack for months and had an affinity for pornographic yoga and a documented disdain for the opposite sex.Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, Chief Michael DeLeo said that while Mr. Beierle had no known connection to any the seven victims (six were female), he was “a disturbed individual who harbored hatred towards women.”One of the documents recovered from a hotel room where Mr. Beierle had been staying said: “If I can’t find one decent female to live with, I will find many indecent females to die with. If they are intent on denying me life, I will have no choice, but to deny them life. At least I will no longer have to live under the reign of a monkey. America deserves a thousand 9/11s for this outrage.”Mr. Beierle, a 40-year-old alumnus of Florida State University, had a history of sexual misconduct against women going back to grade school through his military career, and an equally long trail of misogynistic and racist content posted on the web, including songs he wrote and recorded about his frustrations and failures in life, love and work, according to the investigation.The department interviewed dozens of people and combed through thousands of pages of documents, including journal entries and medical records.In a video titled “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” which Mr. Beierle posted online four years before the attack, he invoked Elliot O. Rodger, the 22-year-old gunman who documented his rage against women for rejecting him before he killed six people, injured 14 others and took his own life in a 2014 rampage in Isla Vista, Calif. Both men identified as involuntary celibates.The last song Mr. Beierle posted to his SoundCloud account included threatening lyrics to “put someone in a neck brace.”Although Mr. Beierle had searched online for pornographic yoga content as well as locations and schedules of yoga studios in Tallahassee, the department concluded that there was no evidence he had specifically targeted any individual.But Mr. DeLeo said it was likely that Mr. Beierle targeted a “familiar community” in Tallahassee, where records show he had been arrested at least twice, including separate cases in 2012 and 2016 in which he was accused of groping a woman. Both of those cases were dismissed.The department also obtained communications from 2013 between Mr. Beierle and a woman named Jennifer whom he had met online and who mentioned that she had attended a hot yoga class in Tallahassee. The relationship soured after Mr. Beierle sent her sexually suggestive messages, according to the police.Chief DeLeo said Mr. Beierle suffered severe financial stress because he had been fired at least twice from substitute teaching jobs and sought mental health counseling on a number of occasions. Chief DeLeo said that records could not be released because of privacy laws.Days before the shooting, Mr. Beierle purchased a yoga mat and ear plugs at a Walmart and checked into a hotel, according to the police. He canceled his psychiatry appointments with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.On Nov. 2, the day of the shooting, Mr. Beierle left two hotel keys in his room, a sign that he was not planning to return, Chief DeLeo said.Then Mr. Beirele went to Hot Yoga Tallahassee, arriving at 5:29 p.m.Minutes later, Mr. Beierle shot Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, a faculty member at Florida State, and Maura Binkley, 21, a student there, killing them both. Five other people were injured.When Mr. Beierle’s Glock handgun jammed, one person hit him with a vacuum cleaner, the police said. Another pretended to play dead and later escaped.Mr. Beirele shot himself in the head and was found dead in the middle of the yoga studio. He had almost 100 rounds of ammunition with him, Chief DeLeo said.“I know it sounds difficult to say,” he added, “but this could have been even worse than what it was.”Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of victims. There were seven, not six.AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsMeditation has been proven to reduce stress and anxiety, making it a useful tool for those who find traveling taxing. Here are a few ways it can make your trips more enjoyable.By Justin SablichWhen it comes to mindfulness and meditation, you may think it takes years of training — or a spiritual journey — to derive any benefits. But the essence of the practice is actually quite simple, and its techniques can bring a little relief to many stressful situations, including travel. “We’re talking about a sort of a slightly more sophisticated version of the advice that your mom gave you, when you were a kid, of ‘take a deep breath,’ ” said Dan Harris, the co-anchor of ABC’s “Nightline” and the weekend edition of “Good Morning America” who has authored two books about mindfulness and meditation.“You don’t have to believe in anything. It’s a really simple, secular exercise for your brain,” continued Mr. Harris, whose “10% Happier” smartphone app and podcast feature guided meditations. According to the most recent National Health Interview Survey, more American adults are meditating than ever, with more than 14 percent saying they have practiced in the past year, up from 4.1 percent in 2012.Given that one known effect of practicing mindfulness is the reduction of stress and anxiety, travelers could stand to benefit.“There is strong research that shows that meditation can improve mental health,” said Dr. Megan Jones Bell, the chief science officer for the meditation app Headspace. “Meditation can help us learn to be more present, see ourselves and others from a new perspective, and approach life in a more engaged and peaceful way. This can all be really helpful during any part of our lives and especially during travel.”Here are a few ways that practicing mindfulness can make your travels less stressful and more enjoyable.Whether it’s the fear of flying or worrying about missing your next connection, many people feel anxiety when traveling.“We can’t control if the plane is delayed, or if our luggage gets lost, or the traffic on the road, and meditation and mindfulness allows us to learn to accept the unknowns, and even embrace them,” said Dr. Bell.First, focusing on your breathing can go a long way. If flying is a particularly stressful experience for you, Mr. Harris suggests putting aside a few minutes for this before takeoff, whether you’re waiting to board or buckled in your seat. “Just tuning into your breathing or even taking a few deep breaths has physiological benefits, sending messages to your parasympathetic nervous system like, ‘O.K., relax, everything’s O.K.,” he said.The idea is to consider your nervous thinking from a different perspective. “You realize that, ‘oh yeah, this is just the mental state of worry, and I can unhook from it, even if it’s just for a second, so that it doesn’t own me completely,’ ” Mr. Harris said. To gain a better understanding of how mindful breathing and other meditative techniques can help, it’s best to practice them before your trip. If you can manage to develop something resembling a daily or regular habit, the effects tend to be greater.“Any type of mindfulness exercise, whether one minute or 10 minutes, can help your mind and body,” said Dr. Bell, who recommends starting with a short exercise and then building from there.For those who already meditate regularly, try not to judge yourself too harshly if you’re not able to maintain your usual schedule while traveling.“You’re on vacation, do what you can,” Mr. Harris said. “Sneak it in here and there, but not in a way that’s going to make you or your partner or children miserable or uptight, because that’s just counterproductive.”Mindfulness and meditation can also help you appreciate the destinations you’re exploring.“Traveling is this discovery and exploration process, and meditation helps you tune out or resist the siren call of projection into the future or rumination about the past, all of which pulls you away from what is happening right now, which you paid all this money to experience,” Mr. Harris said.The distractions that come from your smartphone, like social media feeds and the temptation to photograph every moment, can also take away from genuinely enjoying the moment, Mr. Harris explained.“I’m not saying that it’s wrong to take a selfie or to tell your friends about it. What I’m saying is you probably want to up the enjoyment in the moment quotient and reduce the social status quotient,” he said.If you’re struggling to be in the moment, Mr. Harris has a simple suggestion. Asking yourself “‘is this useful?’ can help unhook you from all of that,” he said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Bhadra SharmaKATHMANDU, Nepal — The captain of a Bangladeshi airplane that crashed in Nepal last year, killing 51 people on board, appeared to have experienced an “emotional breakdown” during the flight, a report has found.The findings, released on Sunday by a committee formed by the Nepalese government, concluded that the pilot’s “irritable, tensed, moody and aggressive” behavior during the flight might have contributed to a “loss of situational awareness” when trying to land.The plane, US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211, was landing at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on a flight from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, when it crashed on March 12.Video showed a plane teetering over the runway. When it finally touched the ground, the plane skidded, hit a fence and erupted in a fireball, killing 49 of the 71 people on board. Two others later died from their injuries.Among the dead were 12 Nepalis training to be doctors at a university in Bangladesh. They were returning home for vacation after finishing their final examinations.Their families had stretched themselves as far as they could go to support their children’s attending medical school. Nepal suffers from a dire shortage of trained doctors.Urmila Pradhan, whose daughter, Shweta Thapa, was one of the students who died, was furious at the report’s findings.“She was my only ray of hope,” Ms. Pradhan said, sobbing through a telephone interview. “I was thinking good days were coming, but that pilot proved me wrong. I’m now totally helpless.”In its report, the Nepalese commission found that the airplane’s Bangladeshi pilot, Abid Sultan, 52, who was also in charge of the flight, had been showing signs of problems even before the plane took off from Dhaka.The report said Captain Sultan had slept little the night before the flight and had been unaware of new rules in Bangladesh that required international flights to have air clearance before departing from Dhaka, leading to confusion when he prepared for takeoff.He was also considering whether to resign from US-Bangla Airlines over comments from a colleague who had questioned his competency. In the air, Captain Sultan seemed “very insecure,” the report said. He acted aggressively with other crew members, smoked in the cockpit and complained repeatedly about the colleague’s criticism. (She was not on board.)Once in Nepalese airspace, Captain Sultan failed to follow standard procedures at a critical stage of the landing phase at Tribhuvan International Airport, the report said. This led to the loss of “situational awareness” that had prevented him from properly judging the angle of approach to the runway.The report also blamed air traffic controllers in Nepal for a “lack of assertiveness” in safely guiding the plane, a twin-engine turboprop that can carry up to 78 passengers, to the ground.“Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude,” the report said.Captain Sultan, his co-pilot and the two other crew members on board were among those who died in the crash. The report was compiled using cockpit voice recordings, closed-circuit television footage, a flight data recorder and interviews with air traffic controllers and Nepali and Bangladeshi officials.Though an experienced pilot, Captain Sultan had struggled in the past. In 1993, he was let go from the Bangladesh Air Force in connection with his depression, the report said. He was later cleared to work again and flew planes for several airlines before joining US-Bangla Airlines in 2015, the year after it began operations.Dhaka-Kathmandu was US-Bangla Airlines’ first international route, according to the CAPA-Center for Aviation, a research group in Sydney, Australia. The airline is a subsidiary of the US-Bangla Group, a joint American-Bangladeshi company.In recent medical self-declaration forms, Captain Sultan, who was married with one son, did not disclose his mental health issues, the report found. He also claimed on some forms to have never been a smoker.Based on its findings, the Nepalese government recommended stricter and more regular physical and psychological evaluations for pilots before renewing their licenses.But Pranila Chitrakar, 38, whose husband died in the crash, circled back to Captain Sultan’s checkered history. She wondered why he had been allowed to helm Flight 211 in the first place.“My husband and many others wouldn’t have died if this mentally disturbed pilot was barred from leading the flight,” she said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Palko KaraszLONDON — A veteran British Conservative lawmaker has blocked a bill that would offer greater protection to girls at risk of genital cutting, drawing criticism across the political spectrum, with some calling it an “appalling” move.And it wasn’t the first time.The bill would allow children to be placed in temporary care if they were deemed at risk of genital cutting, as is the case for other child abuse.But because the bill was not introduced by the government, a simple objection in a sparsely attended session was enough for Christopher Chope to block it on Friday on procedural grounds with one word — “Object” — the second time he has done so since November.Mr. Chope’s latest move came a week after a woman in London became the first in the country to be convicted by a jury over the genital cutting of her daughter, at a time of heightened awareness about the issue, prompting reaction from campaigners and senior colleagues.David Lammy, a Labour Party lawmaker, wrote on Twitter, “Christopher Chope embodies a brand of thoughtless, regressive conservatism which can ruin lives.”Nimco Ali, a survivor of genital cutting and women’s rights campaigner, posted an exchange of text messages online in which she had asked Mr. Chope to give the bill a chance. He said no, calling for a full debate.“The truth is, he is simply playing games and doesn’t give a stuff about vulnerable girls,” she wrote on Twitter.Mr. Chope could not be reached for comment on Saturday.Zac Goldsmith, a fellow Conservative, who was among the bill’s backers, called Mr. Chope’s objection “appalling.”In response, Mr. Chope accused his colleagues of “virtue-signaling rather than looking at the substance,” in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper. “My constituents know what I am doing,” he said, adding that he was “not going to be put off” by a campaign of intimidation.The bill against genital cutting, introduced and debated in the upper house of Britain’s Parliament, had already cleared all stages there. But it has to pass the House of Commons before it can become law.On Friday, critics of Mr. Chope argued that his opposition wasn’t purely procedural. He previously objected to measures against taking upskirt photos of women and to the pardon of Alan Turing, the mathematician, computing pioneer and World War II code breaker convicted in 1952 for having sex with a man. (Versions of both bills passed later.)He has also consistently voted against allowing same-sex marriage in Britain, while most of his colleagues generally voted for it, according to TheyWorkForYou, a website that tracks votes and speeches by members of Parliament.Mr. Chope, who was first elected to Britain’s Parliament in 1983, is known for his opposition to the rapid passing of legislation brought without government support, called private members’ bills.In one of the singularities of Britain’s parliamentary system, bills can be proposed by any member of either house. But these texts are given less time for debate, and relatively few become laws. They have traditionally been used to highlight issues, spark larger debate and, in some cases, take the temperature of the room on issues likely to spark controversy.Britain legalized abortion in the late 1960s under a private member’s bill introduced by David Steel, a lawmaker who later became the leader of the small Liberal Party. The Labour government of the time gave its support only later and helped the bill get through Parliament.“I still get a mixture of fan and hate letters as though I were solely responsible for the legislation, when in fact I was just lucky to benefit from a quirk of British politics,” Mr. Steel wrote in The Independent in 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of the bill.A random name-drawing grants priority to some private members’ bills, and he came third in the ballot.Genital cutting — the practice of cutting or removing a girl’s genitalia for social or cultural but not medical reasons — has been a crime in Britain since 1985. It is usually done before girls reach puberty, is extremely painful and can have long-lasting effects on sexual activity, childbirth and mental health.But as more women have immigrated to Britain from countries where the practice is widespread, a study from City University in London estimated the number of women affected at more than 130,000 in a country of 66 million.In a one-year period ending in March 2018, Britain’s national health service recorded 6,195 women and girls with genital cutting, according to data released last year.On Friday, Britain’s home secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Twitter that he was very disappointed by Mr. Chope’s move, adding that he was “determined to stamp out this despicable and medieval practice.”Follow Palko Karasz on Twitter: @karaszpalko.AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert PearWASHINGTON — The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act, and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court.The vote, 240-186, was nonbinding, but it documented the House’s support of the health law, which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans. With the resolution, Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law’s most popular provisions, such as protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for “essential health benefits,” like mental health coverage, prescription drugs, emergency services and maternity care.Eight Republicans voted for it. One Democrat opposed.“The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said. “What are they doing? Just the opposite. Why? Because they don’t believe in governance. That is why they are happy to shut down government.”The resolution, which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump, states, “The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A.C.A.’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and later the invalidation of the entire A.C.A., are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people.”Republicans called it an empty gesture.“This will do nothing for your health care,” said the House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. “But what will it do? It will make a great press release.”Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, said the resolution was a political screed and “doesn’t do a darn thing to protect people with pre-existing conditions.”“Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes, rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions,” Mr. Walden said.Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans’ commitment to health care, an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections.“I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre-existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. “Well, now is your chance to show it.”A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December. Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, that it agreed with the judge’s decision. California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision.If the entire law is struck down, millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government.Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration. But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge.“If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, Republicans will act to protect those with pre-existing conditions,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. “We will work to make health care more affordable, guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals, and we will preserve other important provisions, such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26.”At the same time, Mr. Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a “political stunt.”The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration’s efforts to sabotage the health law.But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr. Trump’s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was “developing a really great HealthCare Plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act.Some, averse to an election-year fight on the issue, have said they would wait to see what Mr. Trump might propose. Some have praised him for raising the issue again.“Back home, what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster,” said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia. “As an elected official, it’s our responsibility to bring solutions. And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now, which it is on this topic, then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for. And I applaud that.”But Mr. Trump pulled back his request for a health-law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election.Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care. Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act, after they failed in 2017, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said, “I would understand their skepticism.”The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law’s requirement for people to have insurance — the individual mandate — as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate.Two Republican state attorneys general, Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana, filed a legal brief this week saying there was “no basis” to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional.They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions, like the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The Justice Department under Mr. Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre-existing conditions should be struck down. But last week, the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid.AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareIt would be easy to look at a photo from the 1980s and conclude that things have changed. Many have not.By Aaron E. CarrollThe racist photo in the medical school yearbook page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia has probably caused many physicians to re-examine their past.We hope we are better today, but the research is not as encouraging as you might think: There is still a long way to go in how the medical field treats minority patients, especially African-Americans.A systematic review published in Academic Emergency Medicine gathered all the research on physicians that measured implicit bias with the Implicit Association Test and included some assessment of clinical decision making. Most of the nine studies used vignettes to test what physicians would do in certain situations.The majority of studies found an implicit preference for white patients, especially among white physicians. Two found a relationship between this bias and clinical decision making. One found that this bias was associated with a greater chance that whites would be treated for myocardial infarction than African-Americans.This study was published in 2017.The Implicit Association Test has its flaws. Although its authors maintain that it measures external influences, it’s not clear how well it predicts individual behavior. Another, bigger systematic review of implicit bias in health care professionals was published in BMC Ethics, also in 2017. The researchers gathered 42 studies, only 15 of which used the Implicit Association Test, and concluded that physicians are just like everyone else. Their biases are consistent with those of the general population.The researchers also cautioned that these biases are likely to affect diagnosis and care.A study published three years earlier in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine surveyed 543 internal medicine and family physicians who had been presented with vignettes of patients with severe osteoarthritis. The survey asked the doctors about the medical cooperativeness of the patients, and whether they would recommend a total knee replacement.Even though the descriptions of the cases were identical except for the race of the patients (African-Americans and whites), participants reported that they believed the white patients were being more medically cooperative than the African-American ones. These beliefs did not translate into different treatment recommendations in this study, but they were clearly there.In 2003, the Institute of Medicine released a landmark report on disparities in health care. The evidence for their existence was enormous. The research available at that time showed that even after controlling for socioeconomic factors, disparities remained.There’s significant literature documenting that African-American patients are treated differently than white patients when it comes to cardiovascular procedures. There were differences in whether they received optimal care with respect to a cancer diagnosis and treatment. African-Americans were less likely to receive appropriate care when they were infected with H.I.V. They were also more likely to die from these illnesses even after adjusting for age, sex, insurance, education and the severity of the disease.Disparities existed for patients with diabetes, kidney disease, mental health problems, and for those who were pregnant or were children.The report cited some systems-level factors that contributed to this problem. Good care may be unavailable in some poor neighborhoods, and easily obtained in others. Differences in insurance access and coverage can also vary by race.But the report’s authors spent much more time on issues at the level of care, in which some physicians treated patients differently based on their race.Physicians sometimes had a harder time making accurate diagnoses because they seemed to be worse at reading the signals from minority patients, perhaps because of cultural or language barriers. Then there were beliefs that physicians already held about the behavior of minorities. You could call these stereotypes, like believing that minority patients wouldn’t comply with recommended changes.Of course, there’s the issue of mistrust on the patient side. African-American patients have good reason to mistrust the health care system; the infamous Tuskegee Study is just one example.In its report, the Institute of Medicine recommended strengthening health plans so that minorities were not disproportionately denied access. It urged that more underrepresented minorities be trained as health care professionals, and that more resources be directed toward enforcing civil rights laws.In practice, it endorsed more evidence-based care across the board. It noted the importance of interpreters, community health workers, patient education programs and cross-cultural education for those who care for patients.All of this has met with limited success.In 2017, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality issued its 15th yearly report on health care quality and disparities, as called for by the medical institute in 2002. It found that while some disparities had gotten better, many remained. The most recent data available showed that 40 percent of the quality measures were still worse for blacks than whites. Other groups fared worse as well. Measures were worse for 20 percent of Asian-Americans, 30 percent of Native Americans, and one third of Pacific Islanders and Hispanics.Of the 21 access measures tracked from 2000 to 2016, nine were improving. Nine were unchanged. Three were worsening.AdvertisementSupported byBy Jacqueline Hesse and Christine McCartney“Students are already surrounded by an echo chamber of one-sided ideas. These implicit biases are shaped by their environments but also come from social media and, unfortunately, sometimes from mainstream news outlets. Classrooms can and should be places where the noise stops, and where students are allowed to linger with their thoughts before committing to claims that they have to prove,” write Jacqueline Hesse and Christine McCartney, teachers at the Newburgh Free Academy in Newburgh, N.Y.Below, they describe how a new approach to teaching research and argument writing has led to a marked improvement in their students’ abilities to examine multiple viewpoints and take thoughtful, nuanced positions. With help from some New York Times articles and images, their students begin to treat the process as one of exploring their own evolving ideas rather than bolstering their original, fixed notions.In honor of our annual Student Editorial Contest, which begins this year on Feb. 21, we’ll be posting ideas for teaching and learning about argument writing all week.You can find two more here and here. Do you teach with The Times? Tell us about it here, or browse our full collection of Reader Ideas._________Challenging Pre-Existing BeliefsThe scenario is familiar: A well-meaning teacher delves into a research unit by asking his or her students to self-select topics that pique their curiosity. The teacher then asks them to choose a side, stake a claim and seek out relevant evidence to support it. What might not be so obvious, however, is the hidden curriculum of this assignment, which reinforces the idea that authentic research involves little more than locating ideas that cement what students already hold to be true.Confirmation bias is the tendency to handpick information that aligns with our prior beliefs; we all fall prey to this in our daily lives. This problem of approaching argument as a means to prove one’s stance has been exacerbated in schools during the past decade by tests that ask students to argue for or against preset claims.Yet, most educators would agree that classrooms should be spaces for students to practice challenging their hunches — places where they can intentionally examine ideas that run counter to their own and spend time weighing alternative perspectives.In line with our colleagues in the National Writing Project, we wholeheartedly believe in the transformative power of writing and, as the writer and teacher Robert P. Yagelski puts it, that “writing instruction at all levels of education can and should be about imagining and creating a better world together.”We have found that students experience freedom when they realize that, in their final papers, they don’t have to prove something they no longer believe after conducting research. In fact, borrowing from a strategy of the Capital District Writing Project educator Christopher Mazura, we ask our students to place their claims along a continuum, with opposing beliefs at each end.For example, a student might write “Professional athletes should stand for the national anthem, regardless of their political beliefs” at one end, while the other end might read “Athletes should be able to choose not to stand during the national anthem as a peaceful expression of their political beliefs.” After new ideas or articles they encounter, students reposition their claims and articulate how and why their thinking has shifted._________Peter Elbow’s “Believing and Doubting” StrategyWe use New York Times articles with the strategy of “Believing and Doubting” as a way for students to examine all perspectives of an argument. The strategy is an adaptation of Peter Elbow’s work, and in the activity, students first read an article for genuine points of agreement and then reread the same article to find value in a viewpoint that differs from that of the author.In other words, first they “believe” the author, and then they “doubt” the ideas he or she puts forth. This is not meant to be an exercise in which students pretend to believe or doubt something they actually don’t, but rather an opportunity for students to look for valuable ideas that may or may not align with their own stances.By using this protocol to examine these texts, we collectively challenge the practice of reading articles simply to confirm our prior beliefs and instead practice engaging thoughtfully with views across a spectrum of opinions.Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein articulate the need for this approach in their seminal book “They Say/I Say.” They argue that it has an “ethical dimension, since it asks writers not simply to keep proving and reasserting what they already believe but to stretch what they believe by putting it up against beliefs that differ, sometimes radically, from their own.” Students should leave school prepared to be active participants in our diverse democracy. This is especially important when inviting students to study critical issues of social justice and equity in our current polarized political climate.Students are already surrounded by an echo chamber of one-sided ideas. These implicit biases are shaped by their environments but also come from social media and, unfortunately, sometimes from mainstream news outlets. Classrooms can and should be the place where the noise stops, and where students are allowed to linger with their thoughts before committing to a claim that they have to prove to be successful on an assignment.We have witnessed a marked improvement in students’ ability to engage in thoughtful conversations through writing or dialogue after explicitly teaching this strategy._________The Research Process as Entering an ‘Unending Conversation’We see the research process as an opportunity for students to explore ideas, and the philosopher Kenneth Burke offers a nuanced way to frame students’ entrance into academic discourse: through the metaphor of an unending conversation.Mr. Burke suggests that when we show up in a parlor where there is already a heated conversation in progress, we do not jump in without first listening to figure out what’s going on. Although there is no way to ascertain the entirety of the conversation from its beginning, he notes that we must listen to all sides for an extended period of time. At some point, when we’ve gathered enough context, we can then join in. And when we leave the parlor, the conversation continues without us.If we extend Mr. Burke’s metaphor to the research and composition process, it becomes imperative that educators create the time and space for students to explore topics from multiple perspectives before wedding themselves to a claim. Using resources from publications such as The Times, students first delve into current events by reading at least three articles about varying topics, allowing their interests to guide them. This is an easy way to honor students’ authentic interests, while still achieving the objectives of a traditional research and composition process.After workshopping possible topics as a whole class, students work in pairs and, later, larger groups to comment on one another’s ideas for research and to articulate their tentative stances toward their chosen topics. Here, students begin to plot their claims along their aforementioned continuums. This process also helps students to begin exploring a range of counterclaims.We then borrow from Mr. Graff and Ms. Birkenstein’s strategy “They Say/I Say” to help students to engage with the ideas in each new article they have read. Students are required to read and respond to at least three articles that address their chosen topic, but many choose to add additional articles as their understanding and engagement grows.To illustrate how students pull from resources such as The Times, one student, Morgan, used Nick Pinto’s New York Times Magazine article “The Bail Trap” to examine how the bail system in our country disproportionately affects the poor. The ninth grader Brianna analyzed the potential dangers of arming teachers using Erica L. Green and Manny Fernandez’s article “Trump Wants to Arm Teachers. These Schools Already Do.” The 10th grader Mariana drew on Erica Goode’s article “Solitary Confinement: Punished for Life” while writing an essay about the psychological problems caused by solitary confinement. The 12th grader Tenaj used Jenna Wortham’s New York Times Magazine interview with Monnica Williams, who was then the director of the University of Louisville’s Center for Mental Health Disparities, in her research paper about the stigma that accompanies mental health issues in African-American communities.After this initial research phase, most students are eager to reconsider and replot their stances on their continuums. We ask that students reflect in writing about why their claims are or are not shifting or deepening. At this point, students are ready to further explore counterclaims using Believing and Doubting, which is followed by once again revisiting the continuum.Before students start drafting, we look closely at prior students’ argument essays, paying close attention to how the arguments are structured. After noticing and naming the successful moves their peers made in their writing, students begin the drafting process. These mentor essays become resources that students return to throughout the process of drafting, revising and peer feedback.In addition to student samples, our older students look at more sophisticated argumentative essays, such as the New York Times editorial board member Brent Staples’s 1986 piece in Harper’s Magazine, “Black Men and Public Space,” which weaves narrative and research to examine race, gender and class. This model illustrates to students the fluidity of essay structure and the power of developing voice.At the end of the process, students are asked to look back at their continuums and write about the evolution of their thinking. We ask them:• What was it like to explore a topic from multiple perspectives?• In what ways did your stance change/deepen throughout this process?• What have you learned about academic discourse? Have you grown as a reader, writer and thinker? If so, how?_________Students Reflect on the ProcessAs our ninth graders reflected, many revealed that this process helped them to access more nuanced understandings of opposing arguments.Stacey wrote, “The new perspective I gained throughout my research was surprising and revealing.” Brianna wrote, “I was able to look beyond my own thinking on the way I feel about a certain topic, meaning that if I agree with something, I should look at someone who doesn’t agree with me to further my thinking.”Another student, Belisa, who was researching the role of peer pressure in the lives of young people and initially took the stance that it has a negative influence, wrote:Through research, I found there is a positive side of peer pressure. I was mainly focused on how peer pressure causes people to do bad things, like lie, cheat and steal. But, given the circumstances, a person can be influenced to do the right things, like study for an exam. While researching, the fact that it’s up to us and the willpower we have to do right or wrong is what really fascinated me.And as our student Thomas stepped into the divisive conversation about whether athletes should be allowed to kneel during the national anthem, he was able to understand the perspective of those who choose to kneel, an action with which he strongly disagrees. He reflected: “The new perspective I have gained from the research is a better understanding and respect for the ‘why we should kneel’ [during the Anthem] stance ... The articles I read explain their point of view ... I now have a more comprehensive view of the opposing argument.”As we strive to cultivate a classroom community where important, real-world issues drive curriculum, these strategies, along with the rich resources provided by The Times, enable us to examine, re-evaluate and deepen our own viewpoints just as our students do. What we are learning is that authentic research leads away from our fixed views on a topic and toward new questions.Andres put it this way: “As more and more questions popped into my mind, I was beginning to understand how many other perspectives there were that I hadn’t considered.”_________Our Call to ActionEngaging in research in this manner highlights the fluidity of argument and emphasizes a growth mind-set in relation to knowledge acquisition. It says that as we receive new information, it is O.K. to change our minds, re-evaluate our beliefs and reposition ourselves in relation to a topic.It is our hope that with the current focus on academic argument writing in schools, educators will continue to push themselves to create strategic and intentional opportunities for students to move away from confirmation bias and into the rich world of academic discourse.AdvertisementSupported byBy Sam RobertsEdward F. Zigler, a psychologist who in the mid-1960s helped design Head Start, the vanguard federal government program for preschool children, died on Feb. 7 at his home in North Haven. He was 88.His son, Scott, said the cause was complications of coronary artery disease.Dr. Zigler was an early champion of guaranteed time off from work for new parents, the teaching of child-rearing skills to teenagers, and the integration of health and social service programs and day care into neighborhood public school buildings.But he was probably best known as one of the architects of Head Start, which began as a summer program under President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty. Jule Sugarman, the executive secretary of a panel commissioned by Johnson, recruited Dr. Zigler and other experts to devise and carry out the program.Since 1965, more than 35 million children have been enrolled in Head Start, which each year provides early education and medical services to about a million children under 5 years old at a cost of about $10 billion.When it was first proposed, the program had its critics, some of whom even called it a Communist plot to take children from their parents and destabilize the American family by encouraging women to work outside the home.But child care became a necessity for more working parents. And research in child development, a discipline that Dr. Zigler helped validate, attributed to Head Start and Early Head Start advances in educational achievement, improvements in physical and mental health and a reduction in delinquency.“He had to really fight to be taken seriously, but he did, and that’s made it possible for the field to have the credibility it does today,” Ruby Takanishi, who was then president of the Foundation for Child Development, said in remarks when Dr. Zigler was honored by the American Psychological Association in 2003.To Dr. Zigler, Head Start was not just another ivory-tower theory to be tested on the nation’s most vulnerable children. He had seen it work in a settlement house in Kansas City, Mo., where he and his immigrant parents learned English and received medical care, meals and social support.“As the son of a non-English speaker, and having grown up in poverty,” Dr. Zigler said, “I’ve been able to exceed expectations and possibilities.”As an adviser to every president from Johnson to Barack Obama, Dr. Zigler sought to debunk what he called “the myth that we are a child-oriented society.”The litany of neglect he outlined included inadequate services for expectant mothers, a proliferation of largely ignored latchkey children, and an increase in child care that was basically custodial. He also worried that children were becoming “overprogrammed” and “not valued for themselves but only for their accomplishments.”Dr. Zigler wrote in The New York Times in 1976 that “children and families all too often come last, and the social barriers to providing a better quality of life for our nation’s children have become almost insurmountable.”President Richard M. Nixon nominated Dr. Zigler to be chief of the children’s bureau of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services) in early 1970. Within months the bureau became the Office of Child Development, and Dr. Zigler became its first permanent director.In 1971, he collaborated with Representative John Brademas of Indiana and Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, both Democrats, to transform child care from what Mr. Zigler called “a welfare mother’s issue” and a “women’s issue” to a national issue affecting workplace productivity.They introduced a bill to provide affordable child care for working families, with fees based on income. It was approved by Congress but vetoed by the president.“Nixon vetoed the bill because of the outpouring of mail from the evangelicals and the far right,” Dr. Zigler told The Times in 1989. “They didn’t want women to work. They said we were Sovietizing America’s children — that children would be raised in centers rather than by their mothers.”In 1975, Dr. Zigler was chairman of a committee overseeing the resettlement of 3,000 infants and children evacuated during the fall of Saigon.Edward Frank Zigler was born in Kansas City on March 1, 1930. His parents, Frank and Gertrude (Gleitman) Zigler, were Jewish immigrants from Poland who sold fruit from a horse-drawn wagon. Ed helped.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018A neighborhood social center also helped the family acclimate. Inspired by the late-19th-century settlement house model, the center’s volunteers lived temporarily in poor urban communities and provided social services.After graduating from a vocational high school and serving in the Army during the Korean War, Dr. Zigler earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Kansas City (now the University of Missouri at Kansas City) in 1954. Four years later he received a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Texas at Austin. He joined the Yale faculty as an assistant professor of psychology in 1959.He married Bernice Gorelick in 1955. She died in 2017. In addition to their son, Perrin Scott Zigler, dean of the School of Drama at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, he is survived by two granddaughters and a sister, Maurine Agron.In 1976, Dr. Zigler was named a Sterling professor, Yale’s highest professorial honor. In 2005, Yale’s Bush Center for Child Development and Social Policy was renamed the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy. He was director emeritus until his death.The author or editor of 40 books, Dr. Zigler developed what was called the first parenting education program for teenagers in the nation’s public schools. He also established a replicable model called the School of the 21st Century, designed to embed child care and other social services in public school buildings.Dr. Zigler later expressed concern that Head Start’s educational impact had been oversold. There was, he wrote in a Times Op-Ed article in 1982, a “mistaken impression that a one-year Head Start program could compensate for a lifetime of deprivation.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Gia KourlasOur guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.BATTERY DANCE at Schimmel Center at Pace University (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.).

He was 95.His son Dr. Jeffrey Rubin confirmed the death.Dr. Rubin, a psychiatrist who spent most of his long career in private practice in Manhattan, was a young analyst in the late 1950s when he found his literary calling — writing a novella, “Jordi,” about a troubled boy. The character was based in part on a child who was being assisted by his wife, a special-education teacher.He followed that book with “Lisa and David,” which examined the inner lives of two young people with severe mental distress.“Lisa and David” was made into the popular 1962 movie “David and Lisa,” directed by Frank Perry and starring Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin, with Howard Da Silva as a psychiatrist. (The two names were switched to avoid confusion with another movie of the time called simply “Lisa.”)Mr. Perry was nominated for an Oscar as best director. Eleanor Perry, his wife at the time, was nominated for the screenplay.Oprah Winfrey produced a television drama of the same name in 1998, based on the original screenplay, with Lukas Haas, Brittany Murphy and Sidney Poitier.The success of the book and movie propelled Dr. Rubin, known as Ted, into another career. He went on to write some 30 books — fiction, nonfiction and self-help. He had a regular column in Ladies’ Home Journal and often appeared on TV to discuss mental health, therapy and people’s daily emotional struggles.“Once he saw that he could write about these things, I mean, he just took off like a rocket, writing more and more,” his son Jeffrey said.Dr. Rubin’s signature was an openness about his own self-doubt and failings, apparent in book titles like “The Angry Book,” “Overcoming Indecisiveness” and “The Thin Book by a Formerly Fat Psychiatrist,” in which — according to the former Times language columnist William Safire — he coined the term “comfort food.”Dr. Rubin’s writing was self-reflective and unflinching. In “Love Me, Love My Fool” (1976), he wrote, “I must learn to love the fool in me — the one who feels too much, talks too much, takes too many chances, wins sometimes and loses often, lacks self-control, loves and hates, hurts and gets hurt, promises and breaks promises, laughs and cries.”Joann Gerardi, an analyst in private practice in New York, said of Dr. Rubin in a phone interview: “He wrote in a way that was clear, that grabbed people and took them along, and that could be understood by readers outside of psychology. But those of us who were in psychology and psychiatry also learned a great deal from him.”He added to the psychoanalytic literature in 1975 with his book “Compassion and Self-Hate.” For many analysts, self-hatred was a concept centered on the loathing, put-downs and recriminations people turn on themselves. Dr. Rubin argued that the category should be expanded, to include any attempt to deny or forcibly undo uncomfortable emotions like sadness, grief or anger. Those are also attacks on the self, he wrote, and compassion for oneself is the healthy way to resolve them.“His great skill was to be able to make rather difficult concepts come alive in everyday words, and to create a sense of generous compassion for the characters in his books with mental illness,” said Dr. Doug Ingram, a clinical professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College. “He wanted so much to convey the sense that the person you find yourself to be is a solid, good person.”Dr. Rubin was born in Brooklyn on April 11, 1923, the second child of Nathan Rubin, a pharmacist, and Esther (Marcus) Rubin, who ran the household.In addition to his son Jeffrey, a psychiatrist, he is survived by two other children, Dr. Trudy Rubin and Dr. Eugene Rubin, also psychiatrists; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson. His older sister, Blanche, died in 2005; his wife, Eleanor (Katz) Rubin, died in 2017.After graduating from Far Rockaway High School in Queens, Theodore attended Brooklyn College, completing his degree in 1946. He served in the Navy in New York and got his medical degree in 1951 from the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland. He did his residency at the Los Angeles V.A. Hospital before completing his specialty in psychiatry at Downstate Medical School in Brooklyn.Dr. Rubin trained in analysis at the American Institute for Psychoanalysis, the Manhattan center founded by the prominent German-American analyst Karen Horney, whose work he admired. He became a fixture there, joining the faculty in the early 1960s and serving for many years as the institute’s president.He also kept a private practice in Manhattan as long as he was able and continued writing. He kept a log of favorite aphorisms he had written, which his son Jeffrey said contained some 1,500 entries.AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundBy John OtisNo one in Vernessa Perez’s small family could understand the behavior she began to exhibit as a teenager.In high school, she began feeling overwhelmed and uninterested in her studies. After dropping out, she began withdrawing from other parts of life. Her days were spent inside, in solitude.“You want to get away from everyone,” Ms. Perez, now 30, said of her mental state at the time. “You want to be in a hole by yourself. You don’t want to bring out ideas or brighten up everyone. You just want to stay in a corner.”She said she knew something was deeply wrong, but denial was easier than trying to comprehend the unknown specter of depression. Amid her loneliness, her mother, the lone caregiver in the home, worked long stretches as a home health aide to provide for her children, a job with a salary that barely covered rent. The family moved frequently.Ms. Perez, who immigrated to the United States from Trinidad at age 9, lived with family and her friends on and off. When she was 18, her instability grew more severe. Ms. Perez stopped grooming herself. Then she stopped eating.Her mother admitted her to Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, where she was placed on a feeding tube because she had lost a significant amount of weight. Ms. Perez’s mother then moved her into the hospital’s Family Care program, a residential service sponsored by the Office of Mental Health.Family Care places people with serious mental illnesses into homes with people specially trained and certified to provide residential care. Clients also receive training and other support from the program. Ms. Perez spent almost all of her 20s under its care.“Family Care provides a life for people who aren’t documented and don’t have anywhere to go, but they have an illness,” said Bill Lampert, the employment coordinator at East New York Clubhouse, which helps adults who have mental illnesses.In 2013, Family Care connected Ms. Perez to the East New York Clubhouse. The support from outside of her family was important to Ms. Perez, who said relatives, some of whom had also immigrated from Trinidad, had a hard time understanding mental illness.“It’s not something we’re used to,” Ms. Perez said in an interview last month. “It’s something new to us. It was new to me, too.”The Clubhouse is run by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.“We did so many things with her,” said Katrina Grant, the Clubhouse’s program director. “She’s met a lot of goals.”One of Ms. Perez’s first goals was to attain her high school equivalency diploma. It took a few years and repeated failures, but Ms. Grant said that Ms. Perez never became discouraged. She succeeded in 2017.“No matter what trials and tribulations she experienced, she always maintained her positive way of looking at things,” Ms. Grant said. “I think that keeps her going.”Another of Ms. Perez’s aspirations was qualifying for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, which she also did in 2017. At last, she was able to work in a legitimate capacity. Ms. Perez completed a training program to become a school-bus attendant, with $450 in Neediest Cases Funds used to pay for the Empire State School matron certificate program.When the school year ended, Ms. Perez got a job at a department store. She has taken a leave to start a family of her own.In May, she married Kishan Perez, 42, whom she met at a Dunkin’ Donuts in 2016. The union allowed Ms. Perez to exit Family Care, and the couple have established their own household in Brooklyn.On Dec. 4, Ms. Perez gave birth to a daughter, Sarai Sue. An additional $271 in Neediest Funds was used to pay for baby items and gift cards.Ms. Perez is excited to tackle the challenge of motherhood and has made it a mission to spare her daughter from loneliness and alienation. “I wouldn’t want her going through the same things I’ve gone through,” she said.Her gregarious disposition has endeared Ms. Perez to many at the Clubhouse, fostering a community of support.AdvertisementSupported byBy Jeffery C. Mays[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Mayor Bill de Blasio surprised many in the city’s political class two years ago when he broadened his push to address income inequality by promising to create 100,000 jobs in 10 years that would pay $50,000 or more per year.“We have to drive up incomes,” Mr. de Blasio said during his State of the City address that year at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. “That means actually helping people to get the kind of jobs that allow you to afford to live in New York City — good-paying jobs.”More than two years later, it’s unclear exactly how many of those “good-paying jobs” have been created because the city has not been keeping track.Officials from the Economic Development Corporation, the agency charged with delivering upon the mayor’s plan, called New York Works, say it is “impractical for the city to track specific jobs created,” in documents reviewed by The New York Times.“We know why those jobs get created and what the specific relationship is to our investment,” Mr. de Blasio said on Sunday after speaking to a group in Concord, New Hampshire where he is considering a run for president.“It’s something we have to do by projection but we believe the projections are clear and effective,” the mayor added.In the program’s first year, city officials said they had “laid the groundwork” to create 19,000 jobs paying $50,000 or more. But that estimate relied heavily on guesswork: Anytime the city did something that was expected to create jobs, such as closing a deal with a real estate developer, completing a rezoning or even entering someone into a job-training program, officials added an estimated number of jobs to the total using job and salary data — even though there was no hard verification that the job was created.The results at times were imprecise.Last year, the city projected that Altronix, a company located in the Brooklyn Army Terminal that provides power and data equipment for security and surveillance, and Jomashop, a watch retail and repair outlet, would each add 50 employees after taking city-renovated space in the terminal.The city has been praised for investing millions of dollars to refurbish the terminal. But so far, only about 20 jobs, mostly from Jomashop, have been added.Representatives from both companies say they are moving into their new space and do plan to expand. “The jobs are going to be phased in over time, but it’s going to happen,” said Marvin Sternberg, founder of Jomashop.The jobs proposal is the third major initiative from Mr. de Blasio, each totaling close to a billion dollars or more, that is being scrutinized as the city deals with declining tax revenues and a directive to cut at least $750 million from the preliminary budget.The mayor recently canceled Renewal, an effort to turn around failing schools that cost $773 million over three years but improved only a quarter of the schools in the program.Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, recently announced he would hold a hearing to discuss the merits of ThriveNYC, the three-year-old, nearly $850 million mental health initiative headed by Mr. de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray.And on Monday, the Council’s Oversight and Investigations Unit will hold a hearing regarding New York Works, with James Patchett, the head of the city Economic Development Corporation expected to testify.“The notion that New York Works will create 100,000 good jobs has the feel of deceptive advertising,” said Ritchie Torres, a Bronx councilman who heads the committee.“Renewal Schools is failing to renew. ThriveNYC is failing to thrive and New York Works is failing to work,” said Mr. Torres, “because there is a pattern of failing to measure outcomes.”Critics of the program from the work force development field say New York Works won’t help enough of the 2.2 million New Yorkers who lack the skill or training to get a job that pays $50,000 or more.In response to questions from the City Council’s investigative unit, officials from the economic development agency said they had chosen “not to burden” companies “with tracking every single job created by their actions,” since “further actions” are often required by the city’s partners to create the jobs.The economic agency’s role is to be a catalyst and to help partners create jobs, they said, adding that they planned to offer a more detailed accounting in the future.“These jobs aren’t conjured out of thin air,” said an agency spokeswoman, Stephanie Baez. “You have to build buildings, train workers, and invest in students. That’s the work we are doing right now.”Stacy Woodruff, a managing director at Workforce Professionals Training Institute, said the city’s job-counting techniques are out of line with industry practices.“If there is no corroboration or auditing, you have to question their methodology and whether New Yorkers are actually getting these jobs,” said Ms. Woodruff, who previously worked for the de Blasio administration as an adviser in the Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development.She recalled how the city’s inattention to job creation claims helped allow a nonprofit named Seedco, which frequently worked with the Bloomberg administration, falsely claim to have placed at least 1,400 people in jobs, according to a report released by the city in 2012.A Seedco director was found not guilty of faking placements during a federal trial but the agency itself pleaded guilty, admitted to the fraud and paid the city $1.7 million in damages.Ms. Woodruff said the incident was a “wake-up call” and should have served as a warning sign for future job creation efforts.Experts in the work force industry say that nonprofits in the field are required to submit extensive documentation to prove that an individual has been placed in a job, which New York Works isn’t required to do.“Why shouldn’t the city be expected to account for resources provided to the business community in order to spur job growth and local hiring?” asked Joey Ortiz, executive director of New York City Employment and Training Coalition.AdvertisementSupported byBy Colin MoynihanMary Boone, a veteran New York gallerist once lauded as the “Queen of the Art Scene,” pleaded for leniency Thursday. But a federal judge sentenced her to two and a half years in prison for offenses connected to a tax fraud that prosecutors said had cost the government $3 million in revenue.“I stand before you today saddened, humbled and heartbroken,” Ms. Boone told Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Federal District Court in Manhattan, adding, “I beg that you give me a second chance.”But after a brief recess, Judge Hellerstein delivered his sentence, asserting that the magnitude of her crimes and their “long and studied nature” required a prison term.“This is a serious offense; all must pay their taxes,” he said.Ms. Boone, wearing a dark blue suit, leaned forward at the pronouncement, resting her face in her hands. She was ordered to surrender in May to begin serving her sentence.For more than 40 years Ms. Boone, 67, has been a fixture in the ever-changing art world, rising from secretary to gallery owner, showing the work of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, sometimes courting controversy and occasionally becoming embroiled in high-profile disputes. She is one of the most prominent art world figures to face prison since 2002, when the former chairman of Sotheby’s, A. Alfred Taubman, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $7.5 million for leading a price-fixing scheme with Christie’s that swindled customers out of more than $100 million.Prosecutors with the United States attorney’s office had asked that Ms. Boone be sentenced to as much as three years in prison for the crimes she had pleaded guilty to — two counts of filing false tax returns. They said Ms. Boone had reported false business losses, used business funds to pay for more than $1.6 million in personal expenses, like renovations to her home, and then falsely claimed those personal expenses as business deductions.But her lawyers had asked for a sentence of home confinement, probation and community service. They also submitted more than 100 letters attesting to her good works from friends, artists and collectors including the Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei, whom she once represented.Ms. Boone was born in Erie, Penn. and had a childhood that her lawyers described as “marked by tragedy and poverty.” Her father died at an early age, they said, and her mother struggled daily to survive. But after opening her own gallery in 1977 in SoHo, she quickly gained attention while selling works by Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and Ross Bleckner. In 1982, when she was 30, New York magazine published a story about her titled, “The New Queen of the Art Scene.”Her gallery was considered by many to be at, or near, the white hot center of the ’80s art boom. The works she displayed there, the critic Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times, were “seen as slanting heavily toward an overtly macho form of Neo-Expressionist painting.”Ms. Boone moved her gallery from SoHo to Midtown in 1996 and later opened a space in Chelsea. She continued to exhibit the work of younger painters and organize shows that drew positive reviews.She also continued to be cited in headlines. In 1999, Ms. Boone was arrested after displaying a handmade shotgun by the artist Tom Sachs and offering live 9-millimeter cartridges as souvenirs. She spent a night in jail, and told reporters her arrest was “an outrageous attack” on artists’ rights. The charges against her were eventually dropped.In 2016, the actor Alec Baldwin sued Ms. Boone, saying she had defrauded him by promising him one painting by Mr. Bleckner, but then providing another, similar Bleckner painting with the same name. Mr. Baldwin’s case was eventually settled with Ms. Boone paying him what was described only as “a seven-figure sum.”In the tax case, Ms. Boone was charged with filing false returns for herself and her gallery for the year 2011. Federal authorities said that she had engaged in similar schemes the two previous years.Ms. Boone’s lawyers had argued against prison time, writing to the court that her troubled childhood led to mental health issues, a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol abuse. The poverty of her early life, they said, had left her fearful that, despite her success, she would end up destitute and dependent upon others.In court Thursday, one of Ms. Boone’s lawyers, Robert Fink, told the judge that she committed her crimes “not because she was greedy, but because she was frightened.”But Judge Hellerstein seemed skeptical, at one point asking how it would be fair for him to sentence someone to prison for narcotics while allowing Ms. Boone to remain free.Prosecutors had argued in a memo to the court last month that Ms. Boone did not deserve leniency. They cited the many personal expenses Ms. Boone had falsely claimed as business deductions, including $793,003 used to remodel her Manhattan apartment, beauty salon purchases of $24,380, nearly $14,000 on products from Hermès and more than $5,000 on items from Louis Vuitton.On Thursday one of the prosecutors, Olga Zverovich, told Judge Hellerstein that there was no excuse for Ms. Boone’s conduct, adding, “It’s brazen, it’s deliberate, it’s extensive and it’s clear that it was motivated by greed.”It is now unclear what will happen to the gallery business. Her lawyers had told the judge that Ms. Boone’s presence was “indispensable” to the business and to “the numerous employees, artists, vendors and others that it supports.”AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundBy Adriana BalsamoEddie Rodriguez approached his financial counselor, beaming in his new navy suit.“It’s a small office,” said Mr. Rodriguez, 42, “but magic comes out of there.”Early last year, Mr. Rodriguez could hardly afford to pay his basic living expenses, let alone buy new clothes. After defaulting another time on his student loans, his Social Security disability benefits were again garnished, leaving him with little. Knowing he needed help, he sought assistance in June from the Financial Coaching Corps, part of the Community Service Society.Mr. Rodriguez is not alone in his struggle with student debt: Federal statistics show that nearly a third of the people who take out student loans have serious trouble repaying them.“A lot of my clients never received good information at any sort of point along the student loan journey,” said Mr. Rodriguez’s financial counselor, Courtney Davis, the community development specialist at Financial Coaching Corps. She helped him rehabilitate his defaulted loans.As a teenager on Long Island, Mr. Rodriguez did not focus on education, he recalled in an interview last month. His parents worked long hours at multiple jobs, including hotel, restaurant and factory work. “They tried their best with what they had,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I know that now.”As a boy, he dreamed of playing professional football and idolized the quarterback Dan Marino. But Mr. Rodriguez was hit by a truck in junior high school, leaving him with a leg injury, and he hung up his jersey.To numb the pain of his injury and the loss of his athletic dreams, he began using drugs and alcohol. His struggle with addiction continued after he became a father at 18.“It was stressful,” he said. “I didn’t know how to be a parent. I wasn’t ready.”He and his daughter’s mother stayed together for several years, and Mr. Rodriguez tried to support his new family.“I took any job I could get: food industry, retail, any labor job,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “Because of my lack of education, it was tough.”He kept working low-wage jobs after his relationship unraveled, and he enrolled at Sullivan County Community College in 2005 to set an example for his daughter, as well as his nieces and nephews. He also began taking out loans.The effort fizzled, and he tried again in 2011, this time at Suffolk County Community College, pursuing a degree in human services and writing for the college paper’s sports section. He took on more loans and continued to work part-time.But he was unable to finish college as he wrestled with addiction and economic stress brought on a major depressive episode. He found himself with more than $30,000 in student debt and relied on Social Security disability payments related to his mental health. On and off over the following years, he would be found in default and unable to receive his full disability benefits.Last year brought a shift. Mr. Rodriguez was proud when his daughter graduated from college, which he called “one of the greatest moments” of his life, and she found a job in the public health field.He committed to receiving help from the Maryhaven Center of Hope rehabilitation center on Long Island, and he has been sober since March, after 15 years of stops and starts.“Keep God first, be honest with myself and never give up — those are the three principles I live by today,” he said. “My first goal always is staying clean. No. 1, nothing will be possible if you don’t stay clean.”Mr. Rodriguez has found a job that is meaningful to him: helping other men with addiction as a wellness coach at the nonprofit organization Reality House.“I started to believe in myself that there’s a better way,” Mr. Rodriguez said.While looking into potential resources to help improve his financial situation, he found support from Ms. Davis at Financial Coaching Corps.“Eddie was really motivated to tackle this issue,” she said. Part of her salary is paid for with support from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, of which Community Service Society is a beneficiary.Mr. Rodriguez is seven months into a 10-month payment plan that, once completed, will bring his loan out of default, improving his credit rating and restoring his eligibility to apply for federal financial aid.Mr. Rodriguez’s next goal is to finish his degree in human services; he hopes to start school again part-time by the end of 2019. This time, he’ll do it with better financial advice.AdvertisementSupported byA government panel’s new recommendations could bring hope to many women at risk for the condition. Here is what the group said and how you can use the information.By Pam BelluckFor the first time, a national health panel has recommended a way to prevent depression during and after pregnancy. This condition, known as perinatal depression, affects up to one in seven women and is considered the most common complication of pregnancy. The panel, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, said two types of counseling can help keep symptoms at bay. Its recommendation means that under the Affordable Care Act, such counseling must be covered by insurance with no co-payment. Here’s a guide to what to look for and how to get help.Perinatal depression can occur during pregnancy or any time within a year after childbirth. As defined by the panel, it can involve major or minor depressive symptoms that last for at least two weeks, including loss of energy or concentration, changes in sleeping and eating patterns, feelings of worthlessness or suicidal thoughts.It’s not the same as the “baby blues,” which is less severe and doesn’t last as long. The panel said “baby blues” can occur right after childbirth and can include crying, irritability, fatigue and anxiety, symptoms that usually disappear within 10 days.Many things can raise a woman’s risk of depression during and after pregnancy. Having a personal or family history of depression is a significant risk factor. Others include a range of experiences that can generate stress: recent divorce or relationship strain; being a victim of abuse or domestic violence; being a single mother or a teenager; having an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Economic burdens increase the risk — about one in three low-income women develops depression during or after pregnancy.There’s no way to accurately screen women for the likelihood they might experience depression during or after pregnancy, but the panel said that any woman with even one of the risk factors listed above should seek counseling to help prevent it. Scientists are trying to understand how genes and hormones play a role in perinatal depression, knowledge that could eventually help predict which women might develop it. “We don’t have a good screening tool specifically for identifying people at risk for perinatal depression,” said Dr. Melissa Simon, a panel member who is vice chairwoman of research at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine’s obstetrics and gynecology department. “We need a tool.”[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The report found that women receiving one of two forms of counseling were 39 percent less likely than those who didn’t to develop perinatal depression. One approach involves cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps women navigate their feelings and expectations to create healthy, supportive environments for their children. The other involves interpersonal therapy, including development of coping skills and role-playing exercises to help manage stress and relationship conflicts.The panel cited two specific programs that have been successful: “Mothers and Babies,” which includes cognitive behavioral therapy in eight to 17 group sessions, with at least two of those sessions after childbirth, and “Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for New Moms” or ROSE, typically delivered in four sessions during pregnancy and one postpartum.The two programs work with both first-time mothers and women who already have children. They are available in Spanish and focus on low-income women. Both are expanding and testing different ways of delivering their curriculum, which is provided free to clinics and community health agencies. The panel’s recommendation will require insurance to cover counseling at no cost to women receiving it. Health providers delivering it might have to pay for costs like babysitting and transportation for pregnant women who attend.The task force evaluated the strongest research available on possible prevention methods, including physical activity, education, infant sleep advice, yoga, expressive writing, omega-3 fatty acids and antidepressants. In the 50 studies it analyzed, there were hints of promise with a few approaches, including physical activity and three programs in Europe (Britain and the Netherlands) that involved home visits by midwives or other health providers. But the evidence of benefit wasn’t strong enough with anything except counseling.The panel also looked for any harm that prevention methods could cause. They found negative effects in the two small studies with antidepressants. One study reported instances of dizziness and drowsiness among women who took Zoloft. The other reported that more women taking Pamelor experienced constipation.That doesn’t mean antidepressants aren’t good at treating actual depression, said a panel member, Karina Davidson, who is senior vice president for research for Northwell Health. After all, that’s what they’re designed for. But the studies so far don’t suggest that these drugs are the best method to prevent pregnancy-related depression before it develops.If you have symptoms, seek help from a mental health provider, a community health center, a primary care doctor, or ask for a referral from your obstetrician or your baby’s pediatrician. Treatment might involve therapy, medication or both. For more advice and programs and support networks in your area, organizations like Postpartum Support International and Postpartum Progress are good resources. AdvertisementSupported byExperts offer advice on how to help children develop a taste for vegetables without hiding them in tater tots.By Rachel CernanskyCereal bars with spinach mixed in or veggie-infused tater tots are great at fooling children into eating greens or broccoli or carrots. But experts say that aside from the fact that these products often use only traces of vegetables, this strategy assumes the children can’t like kale or broccoli itself, and relying on such products makes it far more likely that they won’t.“If kids are not given the opportunity to actually experience the vegetable — how it looks, its taste, its texture — then they aren’t getting a chance to ‘train their taste buds,’” said Dr. Natalie Muth, a pediatrician in Carlsbad, Calif., and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “The goal in raising healthy eaters is to help them learn to like and prefer healthy foods.”To do that requires first knowing what the healthy foods look and taste like.“A lot of parents feed their kids what food companies are telling them is kid food, and not realizing those food choices may be impacting their kids’ health,” said Dr. Nimali Fernando, a pediatrician in Virginia and founder of the nonprofit Doctor Yum Project. In addition to childhood obesity, effects may include gastrointestinal issues, behavioral challenges and other health problems she associates with poor eating habits. “There’s all these ripple effects from the average American kid-friendly diet that are very challenging as a pediatrician to deal with, because it’s so pervasive.”Among commercially available brands, she favors one called Fresh Bellies, which sells purées of fruits and “unmasked veggies.” The fruit and vegetable lines are distinct from one another, rather than blended as fruit-vegetable combinations, which is what most pouch and puréed food brands offer.By mixing the two, the company’s founder and chief executive Saskia Sorrosa said, “kids are never learning to eat vegetables. They’re learning to eat fruit sugars.”Infancy and early toddlerhood are when children are most open to learning new flavors, making this stage of development a critical window for introducing a wide variety of flavors — including or perhaps especially the earthy or bitter tastes associated with vegetables that many parents assume children won’t like. Missing this critical window makes it much harder to accept healthy foods later, but not impossible, and continued exposure or even first-time introductions are important for older children too, since they are forming what are likely to become eating habits for life.That doesn’t mean any of this is easy. Kids often are naturally drawn to what’s familiar and are reluctant or fearful of trying new things, and that includes food. But if children get to experience a food again and again — even if it’s just seeing or feeling it — the food becomes more familiar, and that may mean they are more willing to eat or at least try it. “It starts to make it so these foods are not new anymore,” said Stephanie Anzman-Frasca, a pediatric and behavioral medicine specialist at the University at Buffalo. “If they’re experiencing these more ‘stealth’ vegetables, they miss out on the exposures that help them get over this very normal reluctance to try something new.”Simply introducing new foods repeatedly can help children become willing to taste them. That doesn’t guarantee they’ll like them, but it can go a long way. Following are some strategies experts recommend.Children who eat family dinners regularly, where the atmosphere is positive and engaging, tend to not only consume more fruits and vegetables, fewer fried foods and soda, but also — perhaps unsurprisingly — to be in better physical and mental health years later.When families provide an alternative meal for a child, “then he’s learning, ‘If I don’t eat that, then I’ll eat something tastier,’” Dr. Fernando said. “But if we don’t cater to that, they will end up eating the food that we put in front of them.”Expanding a child’s palate takes time — but they’re not going to starve in the meantime. Often, kids don’t need to eat as much as a parent might think, she said. “Kids are pretty good at knowing how much food they need to eat in order to grow. The best thing we can do as parents is offer a variety of foods on a regular basis.”Providing a few dishes that everyone at the table can choose from — it can be as simple as bowls of cherry tomatoes or chopped carrots — will allow children to make choices about what they do and don’t want to eat, without being taught that they need a separate kids’ meal.To be open to trying new foods, children need to be coming to the table hungry. “We often don’t let toddlers get hungry enough,” Dr. Fernando said. “We’re ready with a Ziploc bag at all moments — if they’re crying, if they scrape their knee.”That makes it harder for them to enjoy dinner, because they’re not actually hungry. If parents substitute more palatable kid-friendly options, children may eat something because it tastes good and not because their bodies are telling them to eat.Melanie Potock, a pediatric feeding specialist in Longmont, Colo., and co-author with Dr. Fernando of “Raising a Healthy, Happy Eater: A Parent’s Handbook,” emphasizes that exposure and even acceptance don’t necessarily mean eating. She suggested letting children use squash cubes as building blocks; slicing a beet open and letting kids “tattoo” themselves with it or use asparagus spears as paint brushes (use juice as paint or just pretend to paint with water). Wash the food when they finish and you can still cook with it so you’re not wasting good food.Over time, this helps make the food less foreign. “That moves the needle closer to tasting it and enjoying it,” said Dr. Fernando.AdvertisementSupported byBy Benedict CareyDr. John Gunderson, whose studies of people with suicidal urges, fears of abandonment and squalls of emotion helped establish borderline personality disorder as a stand-alone diagnosis, providing a foundation for research and the first effective treatments, died on Jan. 11 at his home in Weston, Mass. He was 76.His wife, Susan, said the cause was prostate cancer.Dr. Gunderson, who was trained in Freudian analysis, was evaluating the effects of psychotherapy on people identified as schizophrenic in the early 1970s when he discovered that many of the participants in his study had received the wrong diagnosis. They did not have recurring psychoses, the signature symptom of schizophrenia, but rather a poorly understood syndrome described by the German-American psychiatrist Adolph Stern in 1938: Their mental state was on the “border” between garden-variety neurosis and full-blown psychosis.Dr. Gunderson plunged into the literature on borderline patients and distilled their defining features. These included intense fears of being alone, floods of emotional turmoil and impulsive self-harming, like cutting. He collaborated with Margaret T. Singer on an influential 1975 paper, “Defining Borderline Patients: An Overview,” turning a collection of descriptive accounts into a firm diagnosis. He also developed a diagnostic interview that set the standard for identifying the disorder, bringing focus to what had been a baffling condition.“The way these patients were described before was as treatment failures, as if it was somehow their fault,” Dr. Lois Choi-Kain, director of the adult borderline center at the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Mass., where Dr. Gunderson spent much of his career, said in a phone interview. “John came along and said no, these are symptoms of the disorder, not failures.”That paper and others provided a foundation for research into borderline disorder that had not previously existed, clearing the way for its inclusion as a full stand-alone diagnosis in the landmark third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatry’s encyclopedia of mental disorders, published in 1980.In 1996, Dr. Gunderson published another analysis, “The Borderline Patient’s Intolerance of Aloneness: Insecure Attachments and Therapist Availability,” providing doctors and patients with an X-ray of the condition’s internal emotional terrain.“Being alone is often intolerable to them because it is associated with a profound sense of being bad or evil,” he wrote, “a self-image distortion accompanied by such intense feelings of guilt or shame that the question of worthiness to live often follows.”In therapy, borderline patients play rough. They are, by turns, charming and mocking, detached and enraged, bullying and needy, often threatening suicide. Dr. Gunderson seemed made for the challenge, Dr. Choi-Kain said: He was blunt and provocative himself, giving as much as he took, with a respectful enthusiasm that pushed patients without alienating them.He was adamant over the years that psychiatric drugs did not help resolve borderline symptoms. He favored talk therapies, including what is known as dialectical behavior therapy, an approach developed by the University of Washington psychologist Marsha Linehan.He also published, with Dr. Paul Links, a handbook describing what he called good psychiatric management, intended for nonspecialists, patients and families dealing with the storms of rage and self-loathing of borderline personality. This guide became widely used by doctors.Dr. Gunderson’s long commitment to people with borderline personality disorder had a hopeful payoff. He collaborated on a long-term study, led by Harvard’s Mary C. Zanarini, which found that most people given a diagnosis of borderline personality eventually recover: some 15 percent in the first year, a third by two years, fully 85 percent after a decade.“He was the first person to look systematically at the data and figure out what the heck this diagnosis really meant,” said Dr. Glen Gabbard, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Before John, there were observations, case studies, confusion; after John, we had clarity.”John Gunder Gunderson was born on June 20, 1942, in Two Rivers, Wis., the youngest of three children. His father, Sherman, was a professor of economics, and his mother, Alma (Walter) Gunderson, was a high school English teacher. He grew up in Oshkosh, graduating from high school there in 1960.Determined to be a doctor, he entered Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and found himself in deep water: Everyone else seemed to be pre-med, too, and better prepared than he. He stuck it out, earning his way into a two-year Dartmouth Medical School program that fed Harvard’s medical school, where he finished his degree in 1967.In 1963, while at Dartmouth, he met Susan Riley, a student at Skidmore, on a blind date. They were married in 1965, and she would go on to work in money management in Boston.In addition to his wife, he is survived by two children, Craig and Kelly Gunderson, and five grandchildren. His sister and brother died before him.After completing an internship in Minneapolis, Dr. Gunderson did his residency at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston and received training as an analyst at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. He joined Harvard in 1973 and retired last year, continuing his research and seeing patients throughout his tenure there.AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert PearWASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Trump administration rule that allows small businesses to band together and set up health insurance plans that skirt requirements of the Affordable Care Act.The rule is “clearly an end-run around the A.C.A.,” said the judge, John D. Bates, of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.The ruling was the second big defeat this week for President Trump on a top-priority item on his health care agenda as he has sought to use the courts to obliterate his predecessor’s signature achievement. Another judge on Wednesday blocked Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky.Mr. Trump promoted the small-business health plans as a way to save people from the “nightmare of Obamacare.” He told small-business owners in June that “you’re going to save massive amounts of money and have much better health care.”In the economic report of the president released last week, the White House said the small-business plans — known as association health plans — showed how consumers benefit when the government reduces federal regulations and increases “choice and competition in health care markets.”But Judge Bates said that the rule authorizing such health plans was unlawful and must be set aside because it “does violence” to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the framework for employer-sponsored health plans covering tens of millions of Americans.Large employer-sponsored health plans can avoid some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. But Judge Bates said that the Trump administration had improperly stretched the statutory definition of “employer” to include “virtually any association of disparate employers connected by geographic proximity” — as well as sole proprietors who own businesses without any employees.The lawsuit, New York v. United States Department of Labor, was filed by New York and 10 other states.“We are pleased that the District Court saw past the Trump administration’s transparent effort to sabotage our health care system and gut these critical consumer protections in the service of its partisan agenda,” Letitia James, the attorney general of New York State, said Thursday night.Judge Bates said that the final rule issued by Mr. Trump and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta “creates absurd results under the Affordable Care Act.” For example, he said, two business owners who have no employees would be treated as both employers and employees.Likewise, he said, a group of 51 individuals, none of whom employ anyone, would be treated as 52 employers (counting the association as an employer) and 51 employees and would be free from many requirements of the Affordable Care Act that apply to health insurance in the individual and small-group markets.The Trump administration’s attempt to squeeze self-employed individuals into the definition of employer is “a magic trick,” and the rationale offered by the Labor Department is a sleight of hand, Judge Bates said.Moreover, he said, in issuing its rule for small business health plans, the Trump administration ignored the language and purpose of both the Affordable Care Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa.The final rule, he said, illegally “expands the definition of ‘employers’ to include groups without any real commonality of interest and to bring working owners without employees within Erisa’s scope.”“Because the final rule stretches the definitions of ‘employer’ beyond what the statute can bear, the final rule is unlawful” under the Administrative Procedure Act, which sets the standards for federal rule-making, the judge said.Republicans in Congress have been trying for two decades to promote association health plans through legislation. Using his regulatory authority, Mr. Trump tried to do what Congress could not accomplish.Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia and the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said Judge Bates’s ruling was “an important victory for workers and consumers who would be harmed by the administration’s decision to expand the reach of association health plans.”“The Department of Labor’s final rule is one of numerous examples of this administration’s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act through executive action,” Mr. Scott said.Judge Bates voided major provisions of the rule and sent it back to the Labor Department to determine if any of the rule could be salvaged.Under the rule, issued by the Trump administration in June, association health plans were exempt from many consumer-protection mandates in the Affordable Care Act. They were not always required to provide “essential health benefits” like mental health care, drug abuse treatment, emergency services and prescription drugs.Labor Department officials said association health plans would not be able to deny coverage or charge higher rates to individual employees with pre-existing medical conditions.Small-business health plans have a long history of fraud and abuse that have left employers and employees with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid medical bills. The problems are described in dozens of court cases and enforcement actions taken over more than a decade by federal and state officials who regulate the plans.In many cases, the Labor Department said, it has targeted “unscrupulous promoters who sell the promise of inexpensive health benefit insurance but default on their obligations.” In several cases, it has found that people managing these health plans diverted premiums to their personal use.Trump administration officials had said they would tighten supervision of the plans to prevent repetition of such abuses.On Monday, the Trump administration broadened its attack on the Affordable Care Act, telling a federal appeals court that the entire law should be invalidated. If the appeals court accepts the administration’s arguments, millions of people could lose health insurance, including those who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid and those who have private coverage subsidized by the federal government.The administration’s position, urging the appeals court to throw out all of the Affordable Care Act, stunned members of Congress, including many Republican senators who said they had no desire to revisit the issue after their failure to repeal the law in 2017.But Mr. Trump plowed ahead, promising to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.“The cost of Obamacare to people is far too much,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “The deductibility is ridiculous. It averages more than $7,000, meaning it’s unusable. So Obamacare has been a disaster.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Richard A. Oppel Jr.Unlike most death row inmates, Scott Raymond Dozier wanted to die.Convicted of the 2002 killing and dismemberment of a Las Vegas man, Mr. Dozier waited for years while his lawyers appealed his death sentence. But he found the wait more agonizing than the prospect of execution. Two years ago he abandoned their efforts and urged a judge to set a date.The state of Nevada pressed to execute him, too, in a new lethal injection chamber. Still, the delays continued, the last six months ago. Mr. Dozier grew increasingly despondent, those who knew him said Monday.On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Dozier, 48, threaded a bedsheet through an air vent in his cell at the state prison in Ely, Nev., and hanged himself, prison officials said, ending one of the most significant and bizarre death penalty cases in recent years, one that highlighted the contradictions and shifting politics of modern capital punishment in America.“The prospect of eking out his existence on death row for the rest of his life was unfathomable to him,” said Edgar Barens, a filmmaker who had spent time with Mr. Dozier for a documentary that is still in progress about families affected by death penalty cases.Instead, Mr. Dozier had insisted he wanted to die even if it meant a long and potentially excruciating death from a cocktail of lethal-injection drugs that included fentanyl. But in the end, his execution was delayed after a drug company intervened, saying that it would suffer grave reputational harm if its products were used in the execution against its wishes. A lawyer representing Nevada warned that if these sorts of lawsuits could be filed, it could end the state’s death penalty altogether.And a state judge chastised the state officials for operating in bad faith, finding that prison officials had used “subterfuge” to get those drugs in the first place, after failing to obtain them legitimately.During all of this, as Mr. Dozier sat in prison, Nevada voters elected a new attorney general, a Democrat who was sworn in on Monday, who has declined to say whether he would even continue the state’s legal fight to execute Mr. Dozier.To some experts, Mr. Dozier’s case highlighted an aspect of the modern death penalty as its popularity wanes in many quarters: The relative frequency of executions of so-called volunteers, or those who abandon their appeals and embrace their sentences.Nearly nine of 10 condemned inmates who agree to forgo their appeals have shown substantial evidence of mental illness, according to Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington nonprofit that tracks executions.Mr. Dozier’s case was concerning, he said, because any decision by an inmate to waive death-penalty appeals is not voluntary if they are mentally ill or if it came about because of the effect of the conditions of confinement. Mr. Dozier’s competency did not appear to be an issue in the court process.“By his volunteering for execution and forcing the issue, Nevada had to come up with execution drugs, and they engaged in a pattern of lies and subterfuge in order to do that,” Mr. Dunham said.A prison spokeswoman said Mr. Dozier was alone in his cell and not on suicide watch at the time of his death, but state officials said he had threatened to kill himself before and had tried to obtain drugs or razors that he could use to take his life.Still, some who knew him said they were surprised that he would do so, particularly since a botched attempt more than a decade ago had left him in a coma.“He was concerned that he wouldn’t do it properly, so that’s why he was pretty set in the state following through with the execution,” said one of his lawyers, Tom Ericsson of Oronoz & Ericsson, a Las Vegas firm.That Nevada might never set an execution date weighed heavily on Mr. Dozier in recent months, Mr. Ericsson continued, adding that his client’s mental health had deteriorated after the delays and after being frequently kept in isolation or on suicide watch.“He was just beat down by the prison system,” he said, “and ready to call it a day.”Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers criminal justice, agreed that it was surprising that Mr. Dozier would take his own life.AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump treats Chicago like a punching bag, but its next mayor will break boundaries.By Natalie Y. MooreMs. Moore is a journalist in Chicago. CHICAGO — Few voters imagined two black women would win the most votes in last Tuesday’s crowded mayoral primary race. A former police board president, Lori Lightfoot, will face a county board executive, Toni Preckwinkle, in a runoff on April 2, inaugurating a new era for the city’s racialized political landscape and notorious Democratic machine. Chicago will soon have its first black female mayor.An open seat for mayor, with no incumbent or preordained winner, is rarer than 80 degrees and sunny here in February. Voter turnout was low, at 34 percent, but the civic engagement and discourse around this election was robust. Chicago, my beautiful, darling city, is full of grit and resilience. Yet the decades of entrenched racial and economic segregation means the city is ready to combust. Residents live and breathe inequality. They see cranes downtown and too much disinvestment in their neighborhoods. A shrinking middle class reflects a city getting richer on one end and poorer on the other. Public schools suffer from inequity. Distrust of the police in black and brown communities remains constant.For national politicians, President Trump in particular, “Chicago” is shorthand for broken parts of this country. He loves to tweet about crime here without offering any meaningful solutions. My city is a punching bag. It needs help, and this election can change how outsiders see us.Last fall, Mayor Rahm Emanuel stunned many people when he announced he wouldn’t seek a third term. There was a mad scramble to replace him. By Election Day, the field had dwindled from 21 mayoral hopefuls at the peak to a still-astonishing pool of 14 candidates. They represented a mix of interests, geography, ideology, experience and race. For months, the electorate challenged candidates. Every week, multiple groups held mayoral forums on broad and niche issues — early childhood education, food justice, arts and neighborhood development. One forum billed itself as “plans not platitudes.” Engaged voters demanded answers.I’ve long lamented that elected officials neither acknowledge nor work to dismantle segregation, the defining nature of Chicago. That is slowly starting to change. One community group put together a guide in which candidates answered questions, selected by voters, on racial equity. Half the candidates answered. They fielded questions on whether they supported rent control, raising the minimum wage, reopening mental health clinics, creating green jobs in black and brown communities, replacing the police in schools with wraparound services and ending tax breaks for wealthy corporations. And voters, activists and organizers are primed to command accountability by whichever black woman takes the keys to City Hall.Money didn’t completely determine the outcome. The candidate with the biggest war chest — William Daley — had a familiar last name. His brother and father served as mayor for four decades. And the richest person in Illinois, Ken Griffin, who recently bought the most expensive home in the country, a penthouse in New York, donated $2 million to William Daley. Yet Mr. Daley still placed third.So it is indeed historic that the sun may have set on the Daley dynasty. The state of black politics in the city is changing, too, and complicates for some the idea of who a black candidate is and represents. Ms. Lightfoot and Ms. Preckwinkle won by harnessing votes across racial lines, not just by capturing the black vote. How the chips fall will be based on their message, political baggage and appeal.Ms. Preckwinkle is the Cook County Board president and a seasoned elected official on the South Side who supports criminal justice reform. She has a political base. She’s derided by some as “Queen Sugar” for having cast the tie-breaking vote for a sweetened-beverage tax in 2017 to balance the county budget. Taxpayers recoiled; the backlash was so severe that it was repealed within months. Ms. Preckwinkle also faces criticisms for being too cozy with people in office tied to corruption. Enter Ms. Lightfoot, who could also become the city’s first openly gay mayor. A powerful TV commercial presents her as an outsider, uninterested in smoke-filled, back-room deals. She was the head of Mr. Emanuel’s police reform task force that called for impressive and sweeping changes. But some people can’t reconcile her image as reformer with her past. She’s a corporate lawyer and former prosecutor, and she sat on a now-disbanded police disciplinary agency criticized for not firing bad police officers.Over the next several weeks, I imagine the two pragmatic women will compete to see who is a real progressive. The first female mayor was Jane Byrne, a white woman elected in 1979. Harold Washington was the first black mayor elected in 1983. In these first few days of the 2019 runoff, I’m already cringing at comments about Ms. Preckwinkle and Ms. Lightfoot that sound sexist — based on neither policy nor legitimate critiques. I hope regressive racial and gender politics don’t undermine this race. Black women know this double-edged sword all too well. We have a front-row seat to how black women in the public eye are treated — whether it’s not believing black girls who survived sexual abuse or questioning a woman’s blackness or her love of country. I hope that, this year, a woman leading Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, will symbolize something else. Not a proxy punching bag for the city.Natalie Y.

By Roni Caryn RabinPot brownies and other cannabis “edibles” like gummy bears that are sold online and where marijuana is legal may seem like harmless fun, but new research indicates that edibles may be more potent and potentially more dangerous than pot that is smoked or vaped.The new study analyzed thousands of cannabis-triggered emergency room visits in the greater Denver area, and found that edibles induced a disproportionate number of pot-related medical crises. Edibles were also more likely than inhaled pot to cause severe intoxication, acute psychiatric symptoms in people with no history of psychiatric illness and cardiovascular problems.Pot smokers, on the other hand, were more likely to have gastrointestinal complaints, including a vomiting condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, and they were more likely to be hospitalized if they needed emergency care.Emergency room doctors in Colorado started noticing several years ago that “there were a lot of visits associated with edibles, even though they were not the predominant product used, and they seemed to be sicker compared to those who inhaled,” said Dr. Andrew Monte, an associate professor of medicine and the lead author of the new study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.He also noted that the only deaths in Colorado that have been definitively attributed to cannabis involved edibles, and those deaths were surprisingly violent. In all three incidents, including a murder and a suicide in 2014 and another suicide in 2015, the pot users exhibited extremely erratic behavior after consuming edibles, according to news reports and trial testimony.Ingested pot takes longer to produce a high than smoked pot, making it harder to gauge the right dose to achieve the desired effect, which increases the risk of an overdose, experts say. Ingested pot also takes longer for the body to clear.“When you’re smoking marijuana, you start seeing the effects in a couple of minutes,” said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. “But when you take it orally, it takes a long time to feel the effects, and if you’re taking it in order to feel good and you feel nothing, you may think you didn’t take enough. This is a common phenomenon. People take another dose.”The edible candies “look very innocent and safe, so you take another and another, and slowly it is being absorbed. And then you start to feel awful, before you complete the absorption, and that can lead to a psychotic episode,” Dr. Volkow said.Responses to the effects of edibles and the rate of absorption vary from one person to another, and the THC content in products may not be labeled accurately, she noted. Absorption of edibles will also vary depending on the fat content of the food one has consumed, she said, noting that “the content in your blood is going to be much, much higher when you take it with chocolate or a brownie rather than a gummy bear.”The new study found that though edibles represented less than one-third of 1 percent of the state’s total cannabis sales by weight of THC between 2014 and 2016, they accounted for 238 of the 2,432 cannabis-triggered visits to the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital Emergency Department, or about 10 percent. The authors calculated that there was 309 times more THC sold in flower or smoked form compared with edible products during the three-year period examined.Symptoms also tended to vary depending on whether the pot was consumed as an edible or smoked. Nearly half of the emergency room patients who had consumed edibles complained of intoxication or altered mental status, often accompanied by anxiety, compared with less than a third of those who had smoked the pot.About a quarter of both the smokers and those who consumed edibles experienced psychiatric problems, but those who used edibles were more likely to exhibit acute psychiatric symptoms, while the smokers were more likely to complain of an exacerbation of a chronic condition like depression.In addition, 8 percent of edible users had cardiovascular symptoms, including rapid or irregular heart rate, compared with only 3 percent of pot smokers. Serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, occurred in both groups. Other studies have also reported on the emerging concern of cardiovascular problems being associated with pot use, Dr. Volkow said.Concerns about edibles are not new, and many states that have legalized recreational or medical cannabis, including Colorado, California, Rhode Island, Nevada and Oregon, require packaged edibles to carry a warning that the intoxicating effects may not be felt immediately, said Camille Gourdet, a researcher who studies state cannabis policies at RTI International, a nonprofit research organization.Many states also require edibles to be clearly marked with a symbol warning consumers that the products contain cannabis and are not regular food items, Ms. Gourdet said. Several states also require edibles to have even distribution of THC content throughout the product so it is not all concentrated in a single bite of a cookie or brownie.Dr. Monte, who sits on the Colorado Retail Marijuana Public Health Advisory Committee, said he does not think edibles should be available in the retail recreational market. He said the important message for consumers is that there are more adverse drug events associated with edibles than with inhaled products, and that edibles are more likely to trigger psychiatric illness. First-time users — a group that, in Colorado, often includes tourists, are at particular risk, he said.“If they’re going to take an edible, they should use a very low dose, five or 10 milligrams,” he said. “Take it and do not re-dose before four hours, because it may take a while.”AdvertisementSupported byForget everything you know about time management.By Tim HerreraWelcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, editor Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Let’s talk about how we spend our days. Or, more specifically, how we schedule them.It’s easy to think of our waking hours as blocks of time. Eight hours spent at work, broken up into smaller portions and scheduled out. Then we head off to live our personal lives, scheduling dinners, hobbies, happy hours, concerts and everything else. (Or, ahem, just rewatching a few hours of “The Office” on Netflix.) Rinse and repeat tomorrow.It can start to feel like we’re just living in a routine, scheduled by however much time we think we can allot to a given activity.But what if we’ve been looking at our days all wrong?This week, Smarter Living is publishing a series of stories focused on how we spend our time — or, more precisely, how we spend our attention. So much of what we think about, like productivity, effectiveness or just getting things done, is focused on how we manage our time. But each day this week we’ll have a story that tries to reframe that mind-set and make you consider how you spend your attention, instead of just filling blocks on a calendar.For example: We’re kicking off the week with an absolute blockbuster, must-read story today from Charlotte Lieberman that looks at why we all procrastinate. But instead of listing off productivity hacks or time-management mantras, we examine the emotions that are at the root of procrastination and how we can focus that energy in more healthy (and, yes, productive) ways.Dr. Fuschia Sirois, a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield, told us that procrastination people tend to “engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.” Note what she did not say: that we procrastinate because we’re bad at to-do lists, scheduling or are just plain lazy.Read our full story on procrastination here.Later this week we’ll have stories on how to stay focused when your routines become boring; what we can do to fight back against the modern distractions stealing away our attention; and why we sometimes pre-crastinate.To wrap up the week, on Friday we have a story from the organizational psychologist and S.L. regular Adam Grant that serves as a guide to reframing our thinking on what we choose to invest ourselves in. This passage from that story sums it all up:We live in a culture obsessed with personal productivity. We devour books on getting things done and dream of four-hour work weeks. We worship at the altar of hustle and boast about being busy. The key to getting things done, we’re often told, is time management. If you could just plan your schedule better, you could reach productivity nirvana.But after two decades of studying productivity, I’ve become convinced that time management is not a solution — it’s actually part of the problem.Visit nytimes.com/smarterliving throughout the week to read all of our coverage.I’d love to know what you think (or just hear your worst procrastination stories).

Mays[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Near the High Line in Manhattan, more than 250 people gathered at The Park, a restaurant, last week to hear about a Democratic mayor’s long-shot bid for the presidency.The New York City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, worked the crowd, boasting about the mayor’s accomplishments, and how he had done a “tremendous amount” to “create jobs” and move “the conversation nationally” to important issues.But the mayor in question was not Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, population 8.6 million. It was Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., population 102,245.Both men are considering a presidential run but only one of their potential candidacies seems to be taken seriously.Mr. Buttigieg, 37, has raised money from more than 65,000 individual donors, qualifying him to participate in the first Democratic debate in June. A recent poll of the Iowa caucus by Emerson Polling placed Mr. Buttigieg in third among Democrats.Mr. de Blasio, 57, has appeared before small crowds in early primary states such as Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire, and came in last in a recent Quinnipiac University poll that asked which New York politician would make the best president.“Bill de Blasio’s Embarrassing Quest for National Fame,” was the headline on a recent article in The New Republic about Mr. de Blasio’s travels to early primary states.Even in New York, Mr. Buttigieg, perhaps unsurprisingly, seemed to be the mayor of choice for a White House bid.“Mayor Pete is fresh, he’s untainted,” said Michael Zorek, 58, who attended a fund-raiser Friday for Mr. Buttigieg in Chelsea with his wife, Shelly Friedland, 53, a lawyer; the couple lives on the Upper West Side. “He has an entirely different story than any other politician in our lifetime.”Mr. Buttigieg (pronounced BOOT-edge-edge) is gay and married and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who speaks Arabic. He gained exposure in 2017 after a failed run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee.“Mayor de Blasio’s record here is mixed,” Ms. Friedland chimed in. “I don’t think he’s terrible, but I don’t support him moving to another job.”Katie Held, 35, a tech product manager who has lived in Manhattan for four years, said Mr. Buttigieg has “East Coast values with a Midwestern knowledge.”Asked about a potential de Blasio campaign for president, Ms. Held said, “No. Stay where you are. Work on that.”Ever since Mr. de Blasio unexpectedly emerged from a clump of Democrats to become mayor in 2013, he has sought to broaden his message and profile to a national audience.Mr. de Blasio quickly achieved his signature accomplishment, universal prekindergarten, but his tenure has been marred by increased homelessness, the continued deterioration of the city’s public housing stock and scrutiny over some of his fund-raising techniques.He has even been blamed for the city’s troubled subway system although he is not in charge of it.Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said comparing Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. de Blasio was “apples and oranges” because the mayor is not a candidate. Mr. Casca, it should be noted, previously worked for Bernie Sanders on his 2016 presidential campaign and in his Senate office, and is one of two City Hall aides helping the mayor with his presidential aspirations.Rebecca Katz, a former special adviser to Mr. de Blasio who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid, said that the mayor “has a progressive record to run on that is strong, but of all the candidates he has the busiest day job.”“Bill de Blasio put almost as many kids through pre-K last year as who live in South Bend,” she added.But there is no question that Mr. Buttigieg has generated more buzz; his recent visit to Manhattan was his third fund-raising effort in New York City.“To have an openly gay mayor to now be considered the hottest ticket in town running for president is a very, very exciting thing,” said Mr. Johnson, who is gay.Why not Mr. de Blasio?“I think Bill has accomplishments to point to like universal pre-K,” Mr. Johnson said. If Mr. de Blasio runs, “there needs to be a message that inspires people.”Mr. Johnson stressed that he has not endorsed anyone for president yet; that was also the case for Phil Walzak, a former top de Blasio adviser who attended Mr. Buttigieg’s fund-raiser at The Park.“Mayor Pete has a compelling story and message,” said Mr. Walzak, now the top spokesman for the Police Department. But he added that Mr. de Blasio “has a real record to run on.”Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College, said that there was a general sense that Mr. de Blasio “has not been terribly successful at managing New York City.”He added: “He started out very well, made good appointments, did pre-K, a major achievement, and family leave. The first six months to a year made you hungry to see what was coming next, and the answer was bupkis.”Mr. de Blasio has offered a different view of his tenure; on a recent trip to New Hampshire, he highlighted initiatives like universal prekindergarten and a push to make mental health services more broadly available as things that should become national priorities.All of these efforts are going “full steam,” the mayor said recently, in response to a question of how he would respond to New Yorkers wondering why he was in South Carolina or Iowa. The fact that Mr. Buttigieg is getting more attention will not deter him, the mayor said.“I don’t pay a whole lot of attention to what other folks do,” he said.Mr. Buttigieg also declined to speak specifically about his fellow mayor.“At a moment where the party is really trying to figure out what its future will be, the bigger the range of options, the better off we’ll be,” Mr. Buttigieg said just before leaving New York for South Carolina.Still, it was somewhat telling that Mr. Buttigieg had been introduced by Mr. Johnson, Mr. de Blasio’s City Hall colleague.“One of the most attractive qualities in politics is authenticity, and a good story and a level of enthusiasm and charisma, and I think Mayor Pete has shown that through the course of this short campaign,” Mr. Johnson said. “His message has been inspiring for people, and people at this moment in time want to be inspired.”AdvertisementSupported byThe U.S. is overdue to establish an institute devoted to research on the top cause of poor health.By Joon Yun, David A. Kessler and Dan GlickmanDr. Yun, Dr. Kessler and Mr. Glickman have served to improve the nation’s health as leaders in government, academia and the nonprofit sector.Poor nutrition is a leading cause of poor health and spiraling health care spending. Research from the Tufts Friedman School suggests that poor eating causes nearly 1,000 deaths each day in the United States from heart disease, stroke or diabetes. In 2016, the direct and indirect costs of chronic diseases as a result of obesity were $1.72 trillion — almost 10 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. Poor eating also contributes to disparities in well-being, especially among children: a vicious cycle of bad health, lost productivity, increased health costs and poverty. Poor nutrition and obesity are also a major threat to military readiness. A recent report from Mission: Readiness, a group of more than 700 retired admirals and generals, noted that obesity is the leading medical disqualifier that prevents otherwise qualified Americans from joining the military.Yet many of the most fundamental questions about foods and health — especially their impact on the economy and the military — remain unanswered. There is also tremendous confusion about what constitutes a healthy diet. Despite the urgency of these questions, the sum of research funding for nutritional research across all federal agencies — like the agriculture department, Health and Human Services and Department Defense — is only about $1.5 billion annually. To put this into perspective, national spending on candy purchases is about $40 billion per year. That is why our country needs an institute devoted to research on the top cause of poor health. We would call it the National Institute of Nutrition, and it would be part of the National Institutes of Health. The institute will facilitate and help coordinate incisive research into nutrients, foods and their relationships to better health. Some examples of its focus would include: How to leverage food and nutrition policy and public-private partnerships in a “food is medicine” effort to reduce health care costs.Optimal nutrition for military readiness.Optimal nutrition for treatment of battlefield consequences, including bodily injuries, brain injuries and post-traumatic stress.Relationships between the gut microbiome and health.Personalized nutrition based on life stage, metabolism, health state, health goals and genetics.Health and metabolic effects of major food groups for which effects remain unclear or controversial, such as cheese, yogurt, whole-fat milk, unprocessed red meat, coconut oil, fermented foods, organic foods and more.Optimal diets for weight loss and weight maintenance.Optimal diets to prevent and treat Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes.Optimal diets for cancer, both to reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation and also to directly target the cancer.Health effect of trace bioactives and phenolics, like those in extra-virgin olive oil, cocoa, green tea, coffee, red wine, blueberries and more.Effective behavior change and systems approaches for healthier eating.Effective approaches to reduce dietary and health disparities.Effects of foods on brain and mental health, from the developing brain in infants and children to protecting against memory loss, dementia and depression later in life.Effects of foods on allergies and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.Coordinated new science for translation into national dietary guidelines and policies, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.Discoveries in these areas will help bring down health care costs and recover productivity loss as a result of diet-related diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, many cancers and more. They will also benefit our military readiness, including treatment of injuries. A new nutrition institute will not include regulatory or enforcement functions. Those will remain at the Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture. As the convening body for research in the country, the National Institute of Nutrition would encourage the participation of a large group of stakeholders providing important input into the science of nutrition.There are numerous precedents for creating a nutrition research institute at the N.I.H., which was created by an act of Congress in 1930. Several new institutes have been added there in the years since: For example, in 1937, Congress passed legislation to add a new National Cancer Institute. Ideally, Congress would draft and pass a bill to create and fund a nutrition institute.Although their existence and benefits today are obvious in retrospect, we did not always have— and thus needed to create — institutions such as the Institutes of Health and F.D.A. But their contributions have far surpassed our imagination. The N.I.H.’s original founding vision was to detect cholera and yellow fever. Yet, it began to help train young physicians and now supports cutting-edge research that helps treat and cure many types of diseases. Similarly, the F.D.A.’s founding vision was to regulate contaminated foods; now it helps bring safe and effective drugs to market. None of these mandates or benefits were foreseeable at their founding, and the same is true for founding a nutrition institute today.Establishing a place to research nutrition is also crucial to retain American competitiveness. The governments of China, India and Japan fund similar institutions. Improving the nation’s health through better nutrition will pay large and direct economic dividends. An independent analysis concluded that every $1 spent on research by the N.I.H. has led to $3.20 in economic gains, a return-on-investment of more than 200 percent. Given the role of diet in health and well-being, the current challenges to our military readiness and the spending of one in four federal dollars and one in five dollars in our economy on health care, the right question to ask ourselves is, can we afford not having a National Institute of Nutrition.Dr. Joon Yun is a radiologist and an American hedge fund manager.

West, a 71-year-old screen legend, hated the unvarnished photos her visitor took for “Show” magazine. Still, the women — both trailblazers, yet polar opposites in other ways — spent hours together, and Arbus’s words suggest sparks flew between them.While their sole encounter might seem like a thin premise for a play, Stephen Sewell’s “Arbus & West,” presented by Melbourne Theater Company, spins it into a complex chamber piece. One of Australia’s leading playwrights, Mr. Sewell is known for works tackling politics and power, among them “Myth, Propaganda and Disaster in Nazi Germany and Contemporary America.” But “Arbus & West” doesn’t feel insubstantial by comparison: The women at its center are taken seriously as artists and as individuals.It’s especially true of the larger-than-life West, as famous for her sharp tongue as for her overt sexuality in strait-laced times. Her flamboyant style is a writer’s dream, and Mr. Sewell rises to the occasion.Some of her more famous quotes — such as “Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before” — are expertly woven into the text alongside new witticisms. Of her eccentric all-white interior, reinvented by the set designer Renée Mulder, West memorably tells Arbus: “I just like seeing where I’ve been dirty.”Melita Jurisic, whose credits include the movie “Mad Max: Fury Road,” relishes every line as West. Sarah Goodes’s production takes pains to make her look as visually close to Arbus’s photos as possible, with a very similar white négligé and blonde wig. That could easily make “Arbus & West” feel costumey, but Ms. Jurisic achieves a mix of crude verve and counterintuitive innocence (a trait Arbus noted in the real-life West) that make her performance irresistible.Arbus comes across less clearly. She is a more aloof character: Her raw, intimate portraits of others often did the talking for her. “Arbus & West” strives to paint a nuanced picture. Her privileged background is mentioned, as are her difficult relationships with her family and her husband.Arbus’s mental health issues hang over the action, and the play is peppered with flash-forwards to the day West is told of the photographer’s suicide, seven years after their encounter. (Her initial response is: “Didn’t she have enough people that wanted to kill her?”)Regardless, neither Mr. Sewell nor Diana Glenn, who plays Arbus, manage to quite capture what might have animated her in person. Her lines about photography are oddly bland: It is “an art,” we are told, that “reveals who we really are.” Arbus is “looking for the mythic in the everyday,” she adds. All undoubtedly true, but hardly revelatory.Where “Arbus & West” is most potent is in its exploration of relationships between women, and the generation gap between its heroines’ strands of feminism. West has no qualms about being America’s “wet dream,” as she puts it, and works to maintain an illusion of youth, while Arbus is interested in the cracks underneath that veneer, as always with her subjects.The photographer came of age with the women’s liberation movement, to which West refers derisively as “the bra burners.” Before Arbus arrives, West and her protective dresser, Ruby (played by the outstanding Jennifer Vuletic), refer to her as a man, because it doesn’t even occur to them that a photographer might be a woman.Their attitudes to sex crystallize the tension between them, well rendered by Ms. Jurisic and Ms. Glenn. When Arbus tells West, “You invented sex,” it is with some ambivalence, ostensibly because the actress’s brazenness is foreign to her. When she is asked by West whether she likes sex, there is a moment of silence. Later, West shows Arbus a cupboard full of plaster penises modeled after each of her lovers. According to Arthur Lubow’s biography of Arbus, the cupboard existed, and is narrative gold: Mr. Sewell could mine it even further.It’s still too rare to see women’s stories treated with so much care. Mr. Sewell’s work has been presented in Britain, but Broadway appears to have ignored him so far: Perhaps a star vehicle like “Arbus & West” will convince producers to look twice.The Melbourne Theater Company was entirely focused on American stories this month, with another production running at the Southbank Theater: Iain Sinclair’s staging of Arthur Miller’s “A View from the Bridge.” In this 1955 classic, the illegal arrival of Italian relatives in a Brooklyn home sets a tragedy into motion. After the young Catherine falls in love with one of the immigrants, Rodolpho, her guardian and uncle, Eddie Carbone, is driven mad by jealousy.In Europe and in the United States, Ivo van Hove’s spare 2014 production of the play has become the standard after an extended, award-winning run. In Melbourne, Mr. Sinclair strips the action down further. The only prop is a chair. A quietly insistent soundscape, composed by Kelly Ryall, evokes the docks where Eddie and the arrivals work, while the lighting designer, Niklas Pajanti, immerses the characters in a permanent chiaroscuro.Only the finest writing can survive that treatment. There is no padding in “A View from the Bridge”: Miller’s lines are constantly revealing, charged with tension, to the point, and Mr. Sinclair’s cast draw force from them.As Eddie, Steve Bastoni finds the right balance between the character’s genuine kindness and the toxic masculinity that shapes his thinking. The character’s homophobia — “he ain’t right,” he repeats about Rodolpho, who sings and sews with sweet enthusiasm in the hands of Andrew Coshan — bubbles up slowly but effectively.Zoe Terakes, 18, is a revelation as Catherine. She was named best newcomer at the 2017 Sydney Theater Awards for her portrayal of that role in another production, and it’s clear why. Ms. Terakes’s gauche sincerity as Catherine is torn between her first love and her affection for Eddie lends tragic weight to the play’s outcome. When she tugs at her first “grown-up” dress and jumps animatedly into Eddie’s lap, her innocence is poignant.Mr. Sinclair doesn’t attempt to set the play in an Australian context. The cast’s accents range from Brooklyn-ish to Italian, and the production is faithful to Miller’s text. Yet more than half a century after it was written, and on another continent, this working-class tale continues to resonate like a warning. The Melbourne Theatre Company and Mr. Sinclair have cleared the way for it.Laura Cappelle, a theater critic for The New York Times in Paris, is visiting Australia and reviewing productions in Sydney and Melbourne.AdvertisementSupported byBy Alix StraussEvery Monday, the chef Daniela Mass shows up at Beth Fisher’s Upper East Side apartment with grocery bags full of ingredients like spaghetti squash, salmon, sweet potatoes and Swiss chard. In the Fishers’ kitchen, she prepares three four-person meals for Ms. Fisher and her husband, along with snacks. The weekly cost for a visit by Eat Well Food by Daniela, Ms. Mass’s service, is $300.Ms. Fisher, 56, who is a marketing executive, also works with Laura Solin-Valdina, the owner of the wardrobe makeover company NYCStylist. For the past year, Ms. Solin-Valdina has organized and curated Ms. Fisher’s outfits at the rate of $350 per hour (with a 20-hour minimum).“She cleaned out my closet, updated my wardrobe and brought 10 department stores to my apartment,” Ms. Fisher said. “It was rack upon rack of clothing. It was transformative.”Ms. Fisher is trading time for money, and she is part of a growing number of people who invite human service providers into their homes to help them with time-consuming, errand-like tasks that require skill and focus. “I don’t want to spend my time shopping online or at the stores,” she said. “I would rather spend time connecting with family, staying fit, or reading. Having someone shop for you whether it’s clothing or food is very efficient and cost effective. And both do a better job than I could.”Many people in the city joke that what makes them real New Yorkers is that they never leave their apartments unless they have to. It’s getting easier to do just that, especially for those with money.Once the province of the ultra rich, employing an array of personal helpers has begun to filter into everyday life for many New Yorkers of means.Grocery and meal delivery services like FreshDirect, Amazon Fresh and Seamless have become all but normalized in much of the city. But bespoke house calls are a different beast altogether, delivering actual people to perform actual services. These can include massages, yoga classes, facials, hair treatments, manicures, blowouts, makeup sessions or even time with a professional cuddler.“At home they’re not fighting with the masses; my clients don’t want to wait to see a size or color, or interface with a sales person who is going to upsell them,” Ms. Solin-Valdina said. “When we do our fittings, we have a tailor on hand, and fit clients in their home, with their lighting, so they don’t see the harsh lighting of the store’s dressing room.”Marie Douat is a shirt designer who often makes house calls before or after typical office hours, between 7 and 9 a.m. or 6 and 10:30 p.m.“My customers work a lot. They want a different experience,” said Ms. Douat, who owns DOU.K, the company behind the custom shirts. Her clients are lawyers, financers and entrepreneurs who spend between $300 and $900 on a single shirt. Last year she had 50 customers. Within the first three months of this year, she has already surpassed that number.“They like that I’m just focusing on them and talking about their life, that there isn’t another customer,” Ms. Douat said. “Then they can go back to work once I leave.”To be sure, these services are still a luxury; they are not exactly mainstream. Many busy urbanites who have bigger budgets than windows of free time are rethinking how they want to use that time, said Dr. Pam Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, in Newport Beach, Calif. “The only way to get more time is to be intentional about how we use it, which is what people are doing.”Privacy in the age of transparency is also a factor, said Ellis Monk, assistant professor of sociology at Harvard University. “There’s this idea in the age of social media that privacy has become a rare commodity,” he said. By purchasing at-home services, “they are buying privacy and exclusivity simultaneously.”They are also buying human contact. Carried Away Chefs charges $500 for a cook to prepare three four-person meals in a client’s home. But last year, the company added a stay-and-serve offering, where for a $200 surcharge chefs remain in the home to present the meals. The feature has proved popular; it has increased revenue by 20 percent, said Kate Homes, founder and chief executive of the company.In-home services “dovetail really well with New Yorkers who have to negotiate everything — subways, taxis, people. We all dream of having everything done for us,” said Don Grant, a media psychologist and addiction specialist.And although Dr. Grant may not make house calls, other mental health experts do (at a steep price, of course). House Call Psychiatrists is a network of board-certified and licensed psychiatrists in Manhattan who, for $1,500 an hour ($2,000 on evenings and weekends), will send one of their professionals to your home, office or hotel room. Its clientele is a mixture of high-risk patients and wealthy individuals who prefer to stay put in their homes.But convenience comes not with just a price tag but a social cost, too.“These can absolutely have a negative impact on our sense of connection with others,” Dr. Grant said of constant home visits and services. “There’s a loss of value of community. We are social animals,” he continued, who have become “disengaged and have lost the art of small talk.”Dr. Rutledge shared some concerns as well. “If you have tendencies to be a hermit, you can support all this by cutting back on the interactions that give you discomfort,” she explained, replacing many of them with house call or delivery services.But tell that to a busy, overextended New Yorker with Greta Garbo-esque sensibilities, especially when the results are positive. Ms. Fisher, for example, has a whole new wardrobe to show off the 20 pounds she’s lost, which she attributes to having hired her at-home team.“Having a stylist is like a having a shrink or doctor, but is a lot more fun,” Ms. Fisher said. “It’s a treat and an indulgence, but I’ve still accomplished something that adds value and another dimension to my life.”Meanwhile, in an old-fashioned but nonetheless dramatic turn of events on the Upper East Side, the members of the Bolster family have actually been eating the same meal — at the same time — since hiring the services of Carried Away Chefs.AdvertisementSupported byNew Zealand’s prime minister is emerging as the progressive antithesis to right-wing strongmen like Trump, Orban and Modi, whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric.By Sushil AaronMr. Aaron is a journalist.AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, has been exemplary in her response to the massacre in Christchurch, where 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques by an Australian white supremacist and his accomplices. Ms. Arden provided a frame for national grief by embracing the Muslim immigrant community and by firmly insisting, in a tweet after the attack, “Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities — New Zealand is their home — they are us.” She set the tone for the country’s response, framed the incident as a terrorist attack and insisted that her country will reject violent extremism.Ms. Ardern, 38, took over as prime minister in October 2017, after generating a measure of “Jacindamania” and leading her New Zealand Labour Party to victory. Her stature as a serious progressive politician has not been affected by her celebrity status; Ms. Ardern leads in polls even as some of her policies receive mixed reviews.Christchurch marks a turning point for Ms. Ardern and for New Zealand. She has set high benchmarks for messaging and leadership during this crisis. She is expected to unveil specific proposals to reform the country’s gun laws before Monday. Ms Ardern, wearing a black scarf, comforted families of the victims — a remarkable gesture given the reactions Muslim women’s headgear provokes in many Western countries.New Zealanders have followed their leader’s example. Citizens are declaring that the attacker does not speak for them, donations are pouring in for families, condolence books are being signed, flowers placed in front of mosques. On Sunday, church congregations sang New Zealand’s soaring national anthem that speaks about “men of every creed and race” gathering before God’s face in a “free land.”Through the aftermath, Ms. Ardern has consciously sought to reinforce state ideology and elevate it above private prejudice. She recognizes politics as the domain that decides a nation’s values and is providing strong narrative direction for a society suddenly dealing with exposed fault lines. She is reminding Kiwis to come to terms with the altered composition of her nation and, in fact, told Donald Trump that the best way he could support New Zealand was by offering “sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” On Tuesday, while speaking in the Parliament, she told the grieving families, “We cannot know your grief, but we can walk with you at every stage.” And in a pathbreaking gesture, Ms. Ardern said she will never mention the name of the terrorist, thus withholding the notoriety he sought. She implored others to “speak the names of those who were lost, rather than name of the man who took them.” Ms. Ardern is emerging as the definitive progressive antithesis to the crowded field of right-wing strongmen like President Trump, Viktor Orban of Hungary and Narendra Modi of India, whose careers thrive on illiberal, anti-Muslim rhetoric.Like its exceptional prime minister, New Zealand has a national culture unlike any other in Europe or the Americas. Its isolation and distance makes its distinctiveness possible, and the difference is palpable. It is a spectacularly beautiful country with a population of five million occupying an area larger than Britain. Though an urbanized country with a stable developed economy, it has a pace and an outlook of life that seem at odds with the extractive demands of modernity.Migrants from developing countries relate easily to friendly Kiwis and are often surprised to see children and adults walk the streets barefoot. There are superb public libraries and innumerable public spaces in the form of beaches, bays and parks. Community ties are crucial, work-life balance matters, long weekends are sacred. Public-funded advice bureaus help migrants settle in. The streets are safe, schools are free and university costs are relatively modest. Kiwis complain about lack of public investment in specialized health care but it is already impressive for a foreigner: a full course of prescribed antibiotics costs $3.43. New Zealand grapples with neoliberal pressures but is attempting to hold on to its social democracy.Of course, the country has its problems. Lack of housing is a serious concern, attributed to a property market spiked reportedly by Chinese investors over the years. Maori communities seek compensation for historical dispossession, which is being addressed by a tribunal and conscious promotion of indigenous culture. Mental health comes up as an underdiscussed issue and public infrastructure needs more investment.Cities like Auckland grew rapidly in the last decade owing to thousands of foreign students and workers, which increased pressure on services in ways that Kiwis did not expect. Many New Zealanders are still getting used to diversity and often regret that “the country has changed.” This yields resentment among some that right-wing figures seek to stoke. Muslims have been subject to racial slurs and hate speech since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, but as Mohamed Hassan, a Kiwi journalist put it, not in ways that one’s “life would be on the line.” But there is a vibrant political debate on immigration and about the need to import skilled labor without provoking domestic tensions — all conducted without rancor or vitriol. Migrants will not deny sensing subtle forms of exclusion in securing jobs or promotions at work, but the ingrained commitment to everyday civility among New Zealanders is something an immigrant appreciates the most.Ms. Ardern has a tough road ahead to ensure that the country’s “profile” does not change. The challenges she faces resonate with those in other democracies. It remains to be seen if in her case normative habits and deliberative practice can prevail over nasty right-wing subcultures that are amplified by technology, social media and weapons.Combating bigotry and prejudice entails both law enforcement and cultural change. The former is easier, the latter less so. Ms. Ardern will need to use her country’s civility to confront social divisions rather than allow it to foster silences that block a fuller expression of equality for marginal groups. Her government will need to craft newer meanings of national belonging to translate the tolerated and unwanted into the desirable. Democratic discourses must ultimately aim to bridge ethnic silos and parallel cultural lives. It is a challenge fraught with risk for a liberal politician, as a perceived overreach in social engineering can provoke a conservative backlash. It is not easy dealing with both a grieving community and a nation whose self-image has been dented. Right now her moral clarity is inspiring the world.Sushil Aaron is an Indian journalist currently based in New Zealand. AdvertisementSupported byBy Liam Stack, Matthew Haag and Emily S. RuebThe gunman who burst into a SunTrust Bank in Florida on Wednesday made the five women he found inside lie facedown on the floor before he shot them each in the back of the head, killing them, according to an affidavit released on Thursday. And when he was done, he called the police to tell them what he had done.On Thursday, the police released the identities of three of the five victims — four female bank employees and one female customer — and said for the first time that a sixth person inside the bank in Sebring, Fla., escaped when he heard the shooting begin around 12:30 p.m.The suspect, Zephen A. Xaver, 21, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder. Nathaniel Heitkamp, a friend who said in an interview that he met Mr. Xaver five years ago at a mental health facility in Indiana, said, “He had an obsession with violence.”Chief Karl Hoglund of the Sebring Police Department identified the customer who was killed as Cynthia Lee Watson, 65, and one of the employees as Marisol Lopez, 55.At a news conference later in the day, a third victim, Ana Piñon-Williams, 37, was identified by her brother-in-law, Tim Williams. He said she was a mother of seven who started working at the bank recently.“We do not know what was going on in the mind of the individual who committed this atrocious act, but we do know he was influenced by the darkness in this world,” Mr. Williams said.The police said they also did not understand why Mr. Xaver, wearing a T-shirt with an image of four scythe-wielding grim reapers on horseback, carried out the methodical killings in the small city, about 80 miles south of Orlando.Chief Hoglund said on Thursday that Mr. Xaver did not know any of the victims and had no known connection to the SunTrust branch. The chief also said there were no signs that he had intended to rob the bank or do anything there other than shoot people.“We believe it was a random act,” Chief Hoglund said. “We are still trying to establish what has occurred, the gravity and nature of why it occurred, and try to put it in a perspective that we can understand.”When officers arrived at the bank on Wednesday, they found a harrowing scene, according to the police affidavit released on Thursday.Mr. Xaver, who remained on the phone with police, was barricaded inside the bank and said he had a nine-millimeter handgun and was wearing a bulletproof vest. What followed was a standoff that ended when an armored police vehicle rammed into the bank doors, shattering their glass, video footage shows.Inside, the police found five women lying in the lobby with gunshot wounds to the backs of their heads and upper torsos, spent shell casings littered on the floor all around them. They found Mr. Xaver hiding in an office in the back of the bank, the affidavit said.The police initially said on Wednesday that the five victims were the only people in the bank at the time of the attack, but Chief Hoglund said on Thursday that a sixth person had been on the premises when Mr. Xaver opened fire.“There was another bank employee in the building at the time the incident began,” the chief said in an email. “The employee was in a back break room and heard the shots and ran out a back door and contacted law enforcement.”Relatives of the two other victims asked that their names be withheld from the public, Chief Hoglund said on Thursday, adding that he would honor those requests under a new crime victims’ law in Florida known as Marsy’s Law.The shooting on Wednesday was the latest of several high-profile deadly attacks in Florida in the last year. The authorities did not say on Thursday how Mr. Xaver had obtained a gun.At a court hearing on Thursday morning, Mr. Xaver, wearing a black-and-white jumpsuit, stood before Judge Anthony Ritenour and responded, “Yes, sir,” when asked whether he had no income or assets. The judge appointed a public defender to represent Mr. Xaver, who was being held at Highlands County Jail in Sebring, and ordered him held without bond.Mr. Xaver lived in Sebring but had spent most of his life in Plymouth, Ind., a town about 23 miles south of South Bend, Ind., according to Mr. Heitkamp. Mr. Xaver had recently trained to be a correctional officer at Avon Park Correctional Institution, a prison about 20 miles north of Sebring, said Patrick Manderfield, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Corrections.Mr. Heitkamp said he had met Mr. Xaver when they were both teenagers and patients at Michiana Behavioral Health in Plymouth. A representative at Universal Health Services, the company that operates the center, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Over the years, Mr. Xaver complained about being bullied at school and disliked by his family, said Mr. Heitkamp, who now works in the service industry. When Mr. Xaver got upset, Mr. Heitkamp said, he openly talked about a desire to hurt people and how he had access to guns.“This man did not hide it,” Mr. Heitkamp said.Gracelynn Williams, 20, said she became close friends with Mr. Xaver at the same facility in Plymouth several years ago.Reached through Facebook, Mrs. Williams said Mr. Xaver had struggled with suicidal and homicidal thoughts and had a strained relationship with his parents, especially with his father.“He mostly spoke about wanting to hurt himself,” she said.“Society made him a monster,’’ she said. “Unfortunately, nobody listened to him and five lives have been lost. It’s devastating.”An earlier version of this article transposed the identities of two of the people killed at a SunTrust Bank branch. Cynthia Watson was a customer and Marisol Lopez an employee.AdvertisementSupported byThe CheckupSome aggression is normal, experts say; parents can respond with redirection or distraction rather than by punishing the child with anger, yelling or spanking.By Perri Klass, M.D.Behavior problems in children, especially aggression and defiance, don’t get a great deal of sympathy, said Dave Anderson, a psychologist who is senior director of national programs at the Child Mind Institute in New York City. “For a child to get better requires just as much empathy and scaffolding as for a child who might be depressed, but behavioral issues inspire nowhere near as much empathy.”There is a persistent belief that these behaviors reflect poor parenting, he said, but in fact, there is often a strong biological component to behavioral issues, and the responses which come naturally to most parents faced with these behaviors may not have the desired results.“If you’re going to have persistent behavior problems involving aggression and defiance, it’s already elevated at 2,” said Michael F. Lorber, a senior research scientist with the Family Translational Research Group at New York University. In a study published last year in the Journal of Pediatrics, Dr. Lorber and his colleagues looked at 477 children from 6 to 24 months of age, asking their mothers to report on how often in the past month the children had shown specific behaviors ranging from kicking and hitting to pulling hair, biting and even hurting animals.These behaviors were very common, with some actions (hitting or smacking someone) much more common than others (hurting animals). The prevalence of the behaviors tended to increase over time, with hitting peaking at 18 months, and kicking and pushing, as well as throwing objects at people, peaking at 20 months. “Eight of 10 kids were hitting and smacking at 18 months,” Dr. Lorber said. “The terrible twos started before 2.”Not only were more toddlers hitting as they got older, but they were hitting more frequently, so that the 24-month-olds were reported to be hitting nearly four to six days a week.On the other hand, hair-pulling decreased with age, as did scratching, and the researchers speculated that the increased incidence of those behaviors among the younger children may reflect the close contact they have, since they are usually being held.The researchers suggested that pediatricians can reassure parents that these behaviors are normal in small children, but also guide parents, right from the beginning, in setting limits and responding in ways that may help — redirecting or distracting a child — rather than by punishing the child with anger, yelling or spanking.Though these behaviors are seen in almost all children, those toddlers who act aggressively more frequently and consistently may need more help — and so may their parents. “These behaviors are not inconsequential,” Dr. Lorber said. “Kids who are more aggressive also tend to be more tantrummy, more irritable.”And those problems persist as the children grow, he said. “Although aggression is normative, some kids do it a lot more than others,” Dr. Lorber said. “The kids who are really high frequency — it’s happening every day, multiple behaviors are happening every day — those are probably the kids who have passed some threshold where that would warrant special additional attention like referrals to parenting intervention services.” They should also be evaluated to make sure that nothing else is going on, from a physical problem causing pain and irritability to an impairment in hearing or speech causing frustration.Dr. Anderson said that aggressive behavior in children at the extreme can be one symptom of a behavior disorder. The important questions in separating out normal (if unpleasant) behavior from a disorder include the frequency, intensity and duration of the behavior, and whether it is making trouble for the child, getting him kicked out of preschool, or leaving her friendless on the playground.But while parents may think about this as a dichotomy, he said — does the child have a disorder or not — in fact, clinicians who work with behavior problems believe that there are strategies that every parent could use.“Our instincts as human beings are often wrong,” Dr. Anderson said.“We tend to be negative behavior detectors.” When two siblings are playing quietly together, he said, “most parents are thinking, don’t jinx it, or let me go do something on my to-do list.” But when there is conflict, parents respond with anger and threats and punishment.Those ways of responding to the negative behaviors, he said, are unlikely to work — with small children, with adolescents or with adults. “We don’t tell partners to yell at partners as part of couples therapy; we don’t tell bosses to yell at employees for better productivity.”Parents should set up clear expectations before a problem develops, he said, thinking about how to manage getting ready for school the next morning, for example, if today did not go well. And they should offer specific positive feedback for positive behaviors, rather than worrying that they will “jinx” those good behaviors.If a child is having significant behavior problems, parents should be ready to ignore minor misbehavior, he said, such as verbal disrespect or whining. So pick your battles, and don’t give in to the idea that a big punishment is the way to go. “With aggression, lots of parents have a ‘go big or go home’ approach: My child picked a fight, so no play dates, no TV,” privileges rescinded indefinitely, Dr. Anderson said. “The reality is that big punishments do not translate to better behavior.”Instead, punishments should be immediate, consistent and used in small doses; parents should look for ways to remove a privilege for a short time, and establish clear expectations for better behavior. Thus, if a child picks a fight with another child at school, a parent might impose a specific consequence (such as no screens for two days), offer a clear discussion of keeping your hands to yourself, and go over some alternative strategies for moments of frustration: take a break, tell a teacher, interact with another peer. And then, having defined the good behaviors, the parents — and perhaps the teacher as well — need to look for occasions to draw attention to those behaviors.“The moment we see him be mildly frustrated but take a break, whether consciously or unconsciously, we need to catch him,” Dr. Anderson said, and tell him he did the right thing. Some children who act aggressively may actually be anxious, Dr. Anderson said, or may be showing the irritability that can go with depression. Children who have experienced trauma may also have behavioral symptoms.AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundBy John OtisFor Luisa Estefany Jimenez, silence is elusive, sleep even more so.At all hours, her eldest daughter, Jasleen, 9, emits screams and moans that echo through their apartment, threatening to wake the neighbors. The clangs and bangs of thrown objects don’t help.Ms. Jimenez said caring for Jasleen, who is deaf and has trouble communicating, has made her feel perpetually unsettled. She has two other daughters, as well, and is candid about feeling overwhelmed.“It’s hard, hard, hard, hard,” said Ms. Jimenez, 31, last month at her apartment in the East Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. “Everywhere we go, she cries like that or screams or throws herself on the floor.”Throughout her pregnancy with Jasleen, Ms. Jimenez was very ill. During a routine checkup at 35 weeks, she said her doctors detected abnormalities with the fetus. Ms. Jimenez developed high blood pressure, a result of pre-eclampsia, which was interfering with oxygen levels to Jasleen’s brain. The high risks of the delivery were kept from Ms. Jimenez, but doctors told family members, she said.“I saw everybody crying, but I didn’t know what was happening,” Ms. Jimenez recalled. “I thought they were happy because the baby was going to be born.”Jasleen arrived through an emergency cesarean section in 2009. Doctors determined that she had been infected by a virus called cytomegalovirus, or CMV. Like Zika, CMV can cause serious health problems for unborn babies. Jasleen was given slim odds of survival and sent to the Long Island Jewish Medical Center for treatment.She was connected to a maze of tubes, heightening her mother’s panic. When after a week, Jasleen began feeding on her own, Ms. Jimenez was awash with relief.Though she survived, the virus caused microcephaly and cerebral palsy, and Jasleen regularly had seizures. The left side of her body is paralyzed; the atrophy is worsening with age and impeding her already limited mobility.“I feel like I have three children just with her,” said Ms. Jimenez. “I have to do everything for her.”In addition to Jasleen, Ms. Jimenez has two other daughters: Jeyleen, 8, and Juliette, who is almost 2. Ms. Jimenez, who is separated from her husband, relied heavily on her sister to babysit until she went away to college and misses the reprieves, when she would have a chance to walk through a park.“Sometimes I need to think or leave because I get crazy,” Ms. Jimenez said.Of late, she has no real time to herself. Her two older daughters go to school, but Juliette stays home. And many days, Jasleen cannot attend school for health reasons. Ms. Jimenez feels isolated.“I don’t invite anybody or go to anybody’s house,” she said. “I don’t get to sit. I have to be running after her. I don’t go anywhere.”Ms. Jimenez takes medication for anxiety and depression and has been seeing a therapist for nearly a year, which has led her to consider a job in the mental health field. Years ago, she enrolled in nursing school but did not finish because of Jasleen’s medical emergencies.Until recently, Ms. Jimenez was trying to make ends meet by working part-time at a beauty salon her mother owns, though she stopped after her sister left for college.She was reluctant to place her daughter in the care of a home health aide. However, her therapist helped her understand its necessity. Last month, the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities informed Ms. Jimenez that she was eligible to hire a caretaker. Ms. Jimenez said she would want that person to shadow her for two months to observe every nuance of Jasleen’s care before she would leave them alone. “I know it’s hard with her,” she said.To help Jasleen better communicate, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, used $579.78 in Neediest funds to buy her an Apple iPad and a specialized app for it. It also serves as a source of entertainment — playing videos or music — and distraction.Jasleen and her mother know limited sign language. Jasleen’s disabilities have made it difficult to communicate in complete sentences. Often, she is able to sign only a single word. Most of their interactions are driven by a hand-gesture language of their own. To ask Jasleen if she needs water, Ms. Jimenez mimes tipping back an invisible glass.“I know her,” she said. “I know what she wants.”Ms. Jimenez is eager to return to work and believes having a home health aide will give her that chance. She has a dream of one day returning to school. And although she admits that it is difficult to get out of bed some days, Ms. Jimenez is fiercely committed to her daughters.One important tradition in their home is Family Friday. Every week, Ms. Jimenez orders pizza, breaks out board games and puts YouTube music videos on TV for karaoke performances. Jasleen interacts with her sisters, molding Play-Doh sculptures or brightening coloring books alongside them.AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Gold[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Between 2012 and 2018, 14 states and Washington, D.C., passed laws prohibiting “conversion therapy” for minors. Deep-blue New York was not among them.That finally changed this month when the State Legislature voted overwhelmingly to bar mental health professionals from working to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity.As jurisdictions across the country began solidifying protections for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities, conversion therapy became part of the public discourse. In 2016, L.G.B.T. groups denounced the Republican Party for adopting a platform that seemed to lend support to the technique, which had long been discredited by the medical establishment.Vice President Mike Pence has been particularly dogged by criticism; the groups say Mr. Pence had previously been in favor of conversion therapy, a stance that he has denied.New York lawmakers had been proposing bills addressing conversion therapy since 2003. The measures languished until this month, when Democrats took control of the Legislature for the first time in a decade.The Legislature this month also passed the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, or Genda, which would add gender identity as a protected class under New York’s discrimination and hate crimes laws.The bills were the first pieces of L.G.B.T.-specific legislation to pass the Senate since lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2011, State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, said.“It was a quantum leap forward,” said Mr. Hoylman, who is the only out gay lawmaker in the Senate and who sponsored both bills. “I hope we can build on that.”Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said he would sign both bills.“So-called L.G.B.T.Q. conversion therapy is a fraudulent practice that has done untold harm to too many young people,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.Conversion therapy, also called reparative therapy, has been widely denounced by medical professional organizations as traumatizing and harmful to minors. The American Academy of Pediatrics warned against it as early as 1993, saying it reinforced anxiety and shame. In 2009, the American Psychological Association condemned the practice in a report, saying that conversion therapy was predicated on the idea that homosexuality was a mental disorder.But despite the consensus that conversion therapy was unsound, it has remained fairly common, said Mathew Shurka, who underwent conversion therapy and works as an activist fighting against it.An estimated 698,000 L.G.B.T. adults in the United States have received conversion therapy, according to research by the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, which studies L.G.B.T. issues. About half of them underwent conversion therapy as teenagers.Mr. Shurka was among them. He was 16 years old in 2004 when his father took him to a therapist who said he could make gay people straight, and he spent five years undergoing the purported treatment.Conversion therapy assumes that everyone is a heterosexual, Mr. Shurka said, and that same-sex attraction is caused by childhood trauma. The therapists say, “If you can just heal that trauma and understand what your role is as a male or female, you will naturally start to be attracted to the opposite sex,” he said.Mr. Shurka said he was told to separate from his mother and sister for three years to make sure that he did not look at women as his peers.Mr. Shurka worked with Mr. Hoylman and Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who was New York’s first out gay legislator, when they introduced a bill to ban conversion therapy in the state in 2013.At that time, only California had passed a similar law, a year earlier. Months after the New York bill was introduced, New Jersey passed its own legislation barring conversion therapy.Yet New York stood still. The bill cleared the Democrat-led Assembly, but was blocked in the Republican-controlled Senate, where it never received a floor vote.For years, Mr. Hoylman kept reintroducing the bill. Each time, his efforts met the same result, while laws were passed in traditional liberal bastions, like Connecticut and Washington, D.C., and also approved through a bipartisan effort in New Hampshire. There, a Republican legislator sponsored the bill and a Republican governor signed it into law.“New York most certainly lagged behind,” Mr. Hoylman said.Over the years, Mr. Shurka and other advocates worked to educate state lawmakers about conversion therapy. Many of the people he spoke with did not believe conversion therapy was a modern problem, Mr. Shurka said. He blamed that lack of awareness on the stigma associated with the practice.“If your parents are putting you into it, they’re not telling their neighbors or friends,” Mr. Shurka said. “It’s not really talked about, and even for the person that’s in it.”Mr. Cuomo addressed the issue in 2016, when he prevented conversion therapy from being covered by insurers. A number of cities and counties in the state also passed bans, including New York City in 2017.This year, Mr. Hoylman’s bill was passed as part of a slate of policies that Democrats are seeking to enact now that they have full control of the Legislature after winning a majority in the Senate in November.The conversion therapy ban received strong bipartisan support, passing the Assembly 134 to 3 and the Senate 57 to 4.Mr. Shurka, who was in Albany for the Senate vote, said he was “shocked” by the result, which he said was pivotal.“For me, conversion therapy is the source of all L.G.B.T. rights,” he said. “It’s still that question of ‘Can someone change?’”Follow Michael Gold on Twitter: @migold.AdvertisementSupported byBy Elizabeth DiasThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said on Thursday that it would allow children of same-sex couples to be baptized, a remarkable reversal of church policy from one of the religious groups that had long sought to be a bulwark against gay rights.The decision rolled back a 2015 rule that had ripped congregations apart by declaring that church members in same-sex marriages were apostates and subject to excommunication, and that children of same-sex couples were banned from rituals like baptisms and baby-naming ceremonies.The change signals an attempt to heal the rift and represents a broader effort by the church’s newest president to bring the church closer to the American mainstream.The decision, delivered by President Dallin H. Oaks, stops short of ending the church’s teaching that acting on same-sex attraction is sinful. It comes as the church, which has long been known as the Mormon Church, prepares for its general conference for all members this coming weekend.“While we cannot change the Lord’s doctrine, we want our members and our policies to be considerate of those struggling with the challenges of mortality,” the First Presidency, the church’s highest governing body, said in a statement on Thursday. “We want to reduce the hate and contention so common today.The church will still consider same-sex marriage “to be a serious transgression,” the statement said, but “it will not be treated as apostasy for purposes of Church discipline.”“Instead,” it added, “the immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way.”The policy adopted in 2015 allowed children of same-sex couples to join the church only after they reached the age of 18 and moved out of their parents’ homes. They also had to disavow same-sex relationships and receive approval from the church’s leadership.The new policy rolls back those restrictions, and requires that same-sex parents give permission for their children to be baptized and acknowledge the commitments the child is making to the church.Emotions among Latter-day Saints across the country were raw as the news spread on Thursday. In Charlottesville, Va., Meredith Marshall Nelson was at her son’s violin lesson when her brother texted her. She began to cry in relief, and recalled how the weekend that the 2015 policy was announced was the first time in her life that she did not want to go to church.“It felt so incongruous with the teachings of Jesus,” said Ms. Marshall Nelson, 33, who is the editor of the Mormon Women Project, a storytelling outlet. “He said, ‘Let the children come unto me, and forbid them not.’”In Rexburg, Idaho, Kristine Anderson said she and her friends were overwhelmed. “Everyone’s freaking out,” she said. “There is anger, frustration, happiness, all of it mixed.”“Everything just broke” in 2015, said Ms. Anderson, who has three young children. “I couldn’t get out of bed for three days. I cried and cried. I couldn’t even look at the church building, it hurt so much.”Even though the policy is now history, she remains frustrated. “There are so many people who disagreed with the policy the whole time, and we’ve been looked at as apostates and heretics, because you are not supposed to disagree with the prophet,” she said.The decision came nearly eight months after Russell M. Nelson, the president of the church, said that he had received a revelation that the church should no longer be referred to as Mormon, but by its full name. Many observers saw it as a sign that the church aimed to align itself with mainstream American Christianity.“On the one hand, the church is trying to figure out how to keep its younger members and how to be a large church in the 21st century,” Amanda Hendrix-Komoto, an assistant professor of history at Montana State University, said of this moment. “But in other ways, it is also trying to retain its distinct identity.”Churches across the Christian tradition have long wrestled with their own policies about the religious rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and the tension has grown in recent months. The United Methodist Church voted in February to strengthen its ban against gay and lesbian clergy and same-sex marriage, a decision poised to split the denomination. Roman Catholics have debated the role of homosexuality in the clergy sexual abuse scandal, ostracizing gay priests.In Springville, Utah, Alma Loveland stopped going to her Latter-day Saints church around the time that the 2015 policy was announced. “In the ex-Mormon world, it is always a mix of happy and angry any time the church does anything that is positive,” she said. “It is always mixed with, O.K., but you caused this problem in the first place.”It is too early to tell whether or not this reversal may be enough to draw back those to the church who have left the faith altogether. But it is another sign that the church under the leadership of President Nelson, who assumed the role last year, is reconsidering its relationship with the broader American culture.While L.G.B.T. advocacy groups, like the Human Rights Campaign, cautiously welcomed the news, they also noted that it was only a first step. Lisa Dame, vice president of Mama Dragons, a group started by Mormon mothers with L.G.B.T. children, said that it “still does not go far enough to really protect the mental health of L.G.B.T. people, because it sends a message that it is still not O.K.”Affirmation, a group that describes itself as for L.G.B.T. Mormons, families and friends, issued a statement calling attention to “unresolved and hurtful issues surrounding transgender church members.” The church teaches that gender and marriage are eternal, and that men and women are married to each other in heaven.“For people who are queer, it is not quite clear how they could fit into that eternal heavenly family,” Ms. Hendrix-Komoto said.Latter-day Saints leaders have previously supported some gay rights issues, like ending housing and employment discrimination for L.G.B.T. people in Utah, but they remain unmoved about same-sex marriage. The church, and some of its wealthy donors and volunteers, notably pushed California to pass its Proposition 8 ballot initiative in 2008, which at the time made same-sex marriage illegal in the state.Criticism from conservative members of the church was fairly muted on Thursday. But the reversal most likely had widespread support, said Patrick Mason, the chairman of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University, who noted that he had never seen a church policy more openly questioned than the 2015 baptism ban.“They were hearing not just from left, but from the center and the right,” Mr. Mason said of church leaders. “These were grandparents and parents saying this policy doesn’t do anything for us.”Still, for some the decision remains too little, too late. In Millcreek, Utah, all Kathy Carlston could think of when she heard the news was of her late wife, Berta Marquez, who died by suicide last year. The church’s exclusionary policy toward same-sex relationships had played a role her wife’s spiritual and mental state and in her death, Ms. Carlston said in an interview. The reversal, she said, was just a step in honoring her wife’s memory.“Moving forward without apologizing is just gaslighting,” she said of the announcement. “They need to reach out and acknowledge the harm they have caused.”AdvertisementSupported byThe CheckupWhen report cards were sent out on Fridays, child maltreatment seemed to increase on the Saturdays immediately following.By Perri Klass, M.D.I ask children in the exam room how they’re doing in school, and generally they say O.K., or good, or maybe they squirm and say, not so good this year. The pediatric wisdom is always to push a little further, to ask for specifics — what subjects do you like best, which are the hardest, what kinds of grades did you get on your last report card?You want to be alert for clues to problems that can get in the way of school achievement, from learning disabilities to behavioral problems to mental health issues. Asking about report cards is certainly not sufficient, but it’s a quick and almost universal beginning, and maybe a window into family function as well.When I was in school, I remember there were some kids who got financial rewards, a dollar for every A, or some such, and those of us who came from families that scorned such techniques were always deeply jealous, unable to keep from calculating what our take would have been, if only we had different parents.Actually, the standard parental response that I remember, the joke repeated (with accompanying eye-rolls) at least among the students in good standing, was that if you got four A’s and a B, a parent would always ignore the A’s and ask what had gone wrong in the fifth class.When a study was published last December in JAMA Pediatrics showing that when report cards were sent out on Fridays, child maltreatment seemed to increase on the Saturdays immediately following, as measured in confirmed reports of physical abuse, the results provoked conversations about spanking and discipline, about school achievement and behavior.It was also a novel research lens to look at family dynamics. “Nobody else has used report cards,” said the lead author, Melissa Bright, an assistant research scientist at the Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies at the University of Florida.Schools also get “graded” nowadays, and there is research that looks at the economic impact of school rankings, which serve as a sort of “report card” for the schools. A study, also done in Florida, showed that housing prices were impacted when the state started grading individual schools according to student test scores after 2002. “If the state gives a top rating to a school, people want to live in that neighborhood, and there’s a pretty strong housing price bump,” said David N. Figlio, the dean of the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University, who was one of the co-authors. “We’re talking now 7 to 10 percent increases in house prices associated with getting the top rating on the school.”The report cards that schools send out on their students are, cumulatively, a report on how well the school is functioning. But to individual parents, looking at individual children, they may seem to focus attention on a child’s problems or deficits. The recent study was based on anecdotal observations from the health care system and the school system that cases of abuse went up around report card time, so researchers looked at calls to the child abuse hotline, and at the results of the subsequent investigations.They didn’t see an overall blanket increase around report card time, as they had expected, but instead saw what Dr. Bright called “this Friday-Saturday effect; when the report cards came out on a Friday, we did see an increase in calls on Saturday where physical abuse was later confirmed.”“Our hypothesis is, the report cards are coming out, the report cards are bad, bad grades or negative behavioral notes turn into punishment gone too far, turn into physical abuse” from some parents, Dr. Bright said. But the study did not look at the content of the individual report cards, or trace a direct cause and effect relationship between bad report cards and punishment.Why the Friday-Saturday effect with the report cards? “We don’t know,” Dr. Bright said, though researchers speculated that it might be because of the increased amount — and intensity — of parent-child contact on the weekends, and also less sense of being observed by teachers and others who might file reports.“We know kids get punished for poor behavior,” she said. And grades go down when children are physically abused, she said, “so it’s probably a cycle.”There were also, no question, kids I went to school with who talked about the possibility that they would be spanked for bringing home bad report cards, and that would not particularly have stuck out as remarkable during those years (my own parents, devotees of Dr. Spock, had generally resolved against spanking or slapping, and did their level best to keep the resolution).Spanking would not constitute abuse in Florida, Dr. Bright pointed out: “We are one of the 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in schools.”One month before the report card study, the American Academy of Pediatrics had issued a revised policy statement on “Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children,” recommending against spanking in the strongest and most unequivocal terms it has ever used.It’s still hard to talk about spanking. Many parents (and some parenting authorities) are troubled by the idea that all spanking is being regarded as close to child abuse.“I think parents struggle with how they discipline their children,” said Dr. Benjamin S. Siegel, a professor of pediatrics at Boston University and one of the co-authors of the statement. Often they rely on how they were raised themselves, he said, and that can lead to parents feeling, “I was spanked and I turned out O.K.”But many parents who spank their children feel bad about it, he said. “The accumulated evidence says, one, you don’t have to spank, and spanking is ineffective long term.” The evidence shows, he said, “the more you spank, the more aggressive behavior; the more aggressive behavior, the more you spank — there’s a cycle.”Discipline is really teaching, Dr. Siegel said, and “the biggest message is that pediatricians can help parents, parents don’t have to spank.”Family life can be stressful, weekends can be intense, and report cards can be hard on children and on parents.“My take home is that we shouldn’t focus on the negative, we shouldn’t focus on deficits,” Dr. Bright said. Schools should also focus on children’s strengths, and increase communication with families about those strengths, she said. And when report cards come around, schools should try reframing it.AdvertisementSupported byBy Julia Jacobs and Sarah MervoshOn Thursday, the board of trustees at Michigan State University named a top university administrator, Satish Udpa, as the new interim president, to replace John Engler, after roundly condemning Mr. Engler’s comments and accepting his resignation, effective immediately. Read more.John Engler will resign as the interim president of Michigan State University after his recent remarks that some victims of the former university and U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor Lawrence G. Nassar appeared to be enjoying “the spotlight.”In an 11-page letter to the chairwoman of the university’s board of trustees, Dianne Byrum, Mr. Engler said he would comply with her request for him to resign. He will officially step down on Jan. 23, according to the letter.Pressure mounted on Mr. Engler to resign as university administrators criticized his comments, which were reported by The Detroit News on Friday. The letter makes no mention of the remarks that ultimately cost Mr. Engler his job.In reaction to the remarks, the board scheduled a last-minute meeting for Thursday morning to discuss “personnel action.” After receiving the resignation letter, Ms. Byrum, the recently elected chairwoman, said in a phone interview that the board was poised to accept his resignation in a vote at Thursday’s meeting.Ms. Byrum said the board planned to name and vote on a new interim president at the meeting on Thursday. She would not say who the nominee was.Mr. Engler said in the letter than he would be unable to attend the meeting because he was out of town and heading to Texas for his father-in-law’s funeral.In the letter, he details an exhaustive list of what he deems to be his accomplishments during his short tenure, from expanded mental health treatment to a free campus bus service.“The bottom line is that M.S.U. is a dramatically better, stronger institution than it was one year ago,” he wrote.Mr. Engler, a former three-term Republican governor of Michigan, highlighted that “five Democratic members” of the board had reportedly requested his resignation.Earlier on Wednesday, the Deans Council of the university weighed in with an open letter saying that Mr. Engler’s comments about some of Mr. Nassar’s victims were inconsistent with its values. “We do not support his continued leadership and request that the board take appropriate action,” the letter said.“Either he resigns or he will get voted out,” Brian Mosallam, a board member who has been a critic of Mr. Engler, said in an interview on Wednesday.“He just continues to plunge this university into crisis and create weekly, if not daily, distractions,” Mr. Mosallam added. “He needs to step down immediately.”[Here’s a look at the many officials ousted or charged in the Larry Nassar scandal.]Mr. Engler has been criticized by other board members in recent days, including Ms. Byrum, who told The Chronicle of Higher Education that his comments about survivors were “ill advised and not helpful to the healing process, survivors or the university.”“I was hopeful that I would be receiving his resignation letter today,” Ms. Byrum said in the phone interview on Wednesday.Two newly elected board members, Kelly Tebay and Brianna T. Scott, have also distanced themselves from Mr. Engler. In an email on Wednesday, Ms. Tebay called his comments “unacceptable,” and Ms. Scott wrote on Facebook that “leadership starts at the top.” “Tomorrow I’m taking a stand!” she said.The university’s eight-member board must have a majority vote, according to Mr. Mosallam. Requests for comment to all board members were not immediately answered.Mr. Engler, 70, has served as interim president of the university since early last year, after Lou Anna K. Simon resigned as president the same day that Dr. Nassar was sentenced for sexual abuse. She was later charged with lying to the police about what she knew of the abuse allegations against Dr. Nassar.Dr. Nassar was a member of the faculty at Michigan State for years and was the team physician for two female varsity squads, as well as the former doctor for the American gymnastics team. He was accused of sexually abusing hundreds of young women, including several Olympic gold medalists, and is serving what amounts to a life sentence in prison.As interim president, Mr. Engler has overseen the university’s response to the scandal as it faced an onslaught of sexual abuse lawsuits.But he has been accused of being antagonistic toward survivors. In an email obtained by The Chronicle, he suggested that Rachael Denhollander, the first to publicly accuse Dr. Nassar of abuse, was being paid by her lawyer to coerce women into making abuse claims. He later apologized.And in the interview with The Detroit News published last week, Mr. Engler said that a fund to help pay for Dr. Nassar’s victims’ counseling costs might not be intended for all victims, a characterization some board members have contested. He also said some victims were enjoying recognition from the scandal.“There are a lot of people who are touched by this, survivors who haven’t been in the spotlight,” Mr. Engler told the newspaper. “In some ways they have been able to deal with this better than the ones who’ve been in the spotlight who are still enjoying that moment at times, you know, the awards and recognition. And it’s ending. It’s almost done.”Board members had already been searching for someone to lead the school long term and could name the next university president as early as June.Liam Stack and Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.Follow Sarah Mervosh on Twitter: @smervosh.

Is there a reporter, photographer or editor whom you would like to get to know? Tell us in the form below.There are many claims to fame among New York Times journalists, but only one of us has received a note from Beyoncé saying, “Thanks for understanding my heart.”That lifetime bragging right belongs to Jenna Wortham, a staff writer for The Times Magazine and a co-host of the podcast “Still Processing.” Since joining The Times in 2008, she has found a vast, loyal audience for her original takes on pop culture, technology and race. And on social media, where you may know her as @jennydeluxe, she has become something of a cult figure to her hundreds of thousands of followers.[Read Jenna’s piece about Beyoncé and Jay-Z in the magazine’s Music Issue.]Here, Jenna talks about being a young woman of color in journalism, the challenges of social media and her love for a certain reality show.You’re a beloved (and often hilarious) presence on Twitter and Instagram, where you’ve attracted huge followings. How do you think about your life on social media?I try to be extremely aware of my urges to contribute to social media and of the way it feels to observe others’ highly curated looking glasses. Why do I want to share? What does it mean to parcel out bits of myself for consumption? What does it mean to consume others’ bits?I really love getting insights into the highs and lows of the human experience and, at the same time, am aware that we’re being coerced into participating by companies that trade on our emotions and impulses.At social media’s best, I’m laughing alongside some of the most interesting and innovative D.I.Y. creators of my time. At its worst, I’m experiencing a desperate longing for a life that is not mine. That’s a hard spectrum to travel along on a daily basis.What obstacles have you faced as a young person of color working in journalism?For a long time, the issues that concerned me and my communities the most felt difficult to get other people to rally around: pay inequality, the exploitation of marginalized people, digital imperialism, skepticism of Silicon Valley’s values, and wellness and mental health. These things are now of the utmost interest, and that is the most satisfying evolution to observe and participate in.How do you juggle being a writer and a podcast co-host?Podcasting requires an intense amount of collaboration that is fairly foreign to me as a writer. The real-time externalization of thoughts is a different skill set from what I’ve cultivated in my 10 years as a reporter. I feel like I’m learning how to communicate differently, how to work on a team and how to allow myself to feel exposed while a work is in progress. You feel naked and shivering all the time, and it’s thoroughly exhilarating.I bring some of that fearlessness to my writing — I take more leaps and risks and chances, and it feels less scary when they aren’t successful.How do you spend your time when you’re off duty?Off-duty is such an interesting concept! Are any of us ever off?I spend so much of my time invigorated by the ideas swirling around me. I read, I see films and art, I listen to podcasts and talks while I cook, and I see live music and local D.J.s. I practice reiki and do bodywork. I engage in other kinds of personal and spiritual development.Many of my friends are creative types and makers, so we’re always exchanging ideas and getting worked up around the dinner table. I feel really grateful and lucky to make a living doing what feeds me: synthesizing ideas.But I know what you’re really asking. Whenever I have a down moment, I like to take baths with lots of magnesium salt and dried calendula, and to spend time with friends or their babies. Intimate relationships are my lifeblood.I also travel whenever I can. Last year, I went to the South of France and meditated and swam in the Mediterranean Sea. That rejuvenated me to deal with the stressors of daily life. In a few weeks I’m going to Greece to do something similar.If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?Is there a job where you get to be on the beach all day? I’d choose that. I am a water sign and love being near the ocean. Maybe I’d be a filmmaker and work on “Planet Earth: Blue Planet III.”What books have most influenced your work?Books about fearless women who persevered in their fields because they knew their higher purpose was to be in service of equality and civil rights: “Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press,” for instance, and “At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance — A New History of the Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power.” They help remind me to keep going when I get overwhelmed and feel like giving up.“The Black Book,” an anthology edited by Toni Morrison, and the publications of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, started by Barbara Smith, have influenced my work on a visual anthology called “Black Futures” that I’m doing with Kimberly Drew. It will come out in 2020.And Renee Gladman’s books about the imaginary place Ravicka are profoundly reshaping how I think about language.What’s something that readers would be surprised to learn about you?I spend more time offline than online. I don’t have a value judgment about screen time; it’s just that I’ve finally reached a point in my life and career where I spend a lot of time generating inspiration and ideas, not scrolling for them, and that is such a luxury.Also, I love “Survivor.” It’s so good!Illustration by Rebecca ClarkeA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.AdvertisementSupported byBy Roslyn SulcasSergei Polunin will dance at the Paris Opera Ballet. Sergei Polunin will not dance at the Paris Opera Ballet.Barely 48 hours passed between a tweet on Thursday announcing a coming guest appearance as Siegfried in “Swan Lake” by Mr. Polunin, whom many consider one of the finest male dancers of his generation, and an announcement on Saturday by the Opera that the invitation had been withdrawn.The withdrawal came after a furor on social media, responding to news of the Paris performances. That’s because, over the last two months, Mr. Polunin, a former principal at the Royal Ballet in London, has posted around a dozen Instagram messages trumpeting his dislike for homosexuals and “females now trying to take on man role”; and his desire to slap fat people for their lack of discipline. (This last, most recent message has been removed from Instagram.) Beyond those, he has used social media to address his admiration for Vladimir V. Putin, whose image is tattooed on his chest, and his support for Donald Trump.Mr. Polunin, 29, who has more than 170,000 Instagram followers, has achieved fame beyond the ballet world, thanks in part to his solo to Hozier’s “Take Me To Church,” filmed by David LaChapelle, which attracted over 26 million views on YouTube.On the day that the news of his invitation to dance at the Opera was announced, Mr. Polunin wrote on Instagram: “Got strong feeling What if Vladimir Putin would become leader of the world. I will pray for that because it would be ultimate win over evil.” He added: “I believe this will be the future and my energy will help him to do that.”The Ukrainian-born Mr. Polunin, who holds both Russian and Ukrainian passports, has also posted several messages about the need to unite those two countries.Over the past two weeks, Mr. Polunin’s posts have seemed increasingly incoherent and troubling. He expressed homophobic and sexist sentiments in a rambling rant about male and female roles onstage and off: “Man up to all men who is doing ballet there is already ballerina on stage don’t need to be two”; “Man are wolfs man Are lions man are the leaders of there’s family you suppose to take care of everything”; “Stop being weak be a man be a warrior what’s wrong with you???”Several Paris Opera Ballet dancers, dance critics and others, were quick to express dismay. Adrian Couvez, a corps de ballet member, addressed Mr. Polunin directly on Twitter. “Such an embarrassment you are,” he wrote, adding in French, “to invite someone like this to Paris in 2019 is just impossible.” Other dancers and members of the public weighed in, most criticizing the decision to invite Mr. Polunin.By Saturday, Aurélie Dupont, the artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet announced that Mr. Polunin would not appear with the company. A press representative confirmed that Ms. Dupont had written in an internal email that while she “recognized Mr. Polunin’s talent, she had discovered public statements that had shocked her, and which didn’t correspond to her values or to those of the institution she represents.” In response to a request for further comment from Ms. Dupont, a Paris Opera Ballet press representative said she “has already responded and clearly stated her position.”Other social media commenters were critical of Ms. Dupont’s decision. “A renouncement that puts in question her authority and confirms political correctness,” wrote one, while another wrote on Facebook that Mr. Polunin merely expressed “things any rapper band has been bawling with impunity for decades.”Mr. Polunin’s public unraveling is dismaying to the many who consider him a huge talent whose best dance years have been largely lost to the ballet world. Many of his followers have expressed concern for his mental health; others have defended his right to hold whatever political views he pleases. Mr. Polunin did not respond to a request for comment.His story is well known to ballet fans, and was the subject of a 2016 documentary, “Dancer.” The film shows his passage from an impoverished childhood in Kherson, Ukraine, to his arrival at the Royal Ballet School, speaking no English, at 13, and on to his meteoric success at the Royal Ballet, where he became the company’s youngest-ever principal dancer at 19.Two years later, he abruptly resigned, declaring he was bored with ballet, its punishing physical regimen and meager financial rewards. He tweeted about taking drugs, drinking and going to parties, and about the tattoo parlor he co-owned. The British media wrote endlessly about him, calling him “the bad boy of ballet,” and bemoaning the loss of his talent.Mr. Polunin has since pursued a film career, appearing in small roles in “Murder on the Orient Express,” “Red Sparrow” and “The White Crow.” But his dance career has faltered. After leaving the Royal Ballet, he danced with the Stanislavsky Company in Moscow and he has been a “permanent guest artist” with the Bayerisches Staatsballett in Munich. (Igor Zelensky, the director of the Munich Ballet, was unavailable for comment.)But Mr. Polunin’s own venture, Project Polunin, and a joint program with his former girlfriend, the ballerina Natalia Osipova, have met with a tepid critical reception. He is currently scheduled to appear at the London Palladium at the end of May in what is described as “a new mixed program.”AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)It’s Major League Baseball’s opening day.Up and down the state, fans will head to ballparks to see their favorite players, sample the latest food innovations, drink craft brews and take in some fresh air (weather permitting).For David Rinetti, first pitch will be both the end of a sprint and the beginning of a marathon.“I’m not lying when I tell you I probably have about 50 things going on at once,” he said Wednesday morning.Mr. Rinetti is the vice president of stadium operations for the Oakland Athletics. He’s been in that job since 1994, but started with the team as a high schooler.“My job was to pass out a sporting newspaper that had Billy Martin on the front cover of it to our fans,” he said. “My first day of work was passing those out on opening night in 1981.”Suffice to say, things are different. The A’s started sharing the stadium with the Oakland Raiders in 1995, meaning a not insignificant part of Mr. Rinetti’s job became running the stadium’s changeovers from football to baseball.As the team inches toward a new waterfront stadium, I talked with Mr. Rinetti about what it takes to get the 50-year-old Oakland Coliseum ready for the season, and what he’ll miss most about the Brutalism exemplar.So you’ve been around for a while. Tell me about how your job has changed since 1994.It’s changed significantly based upon a lot of the security things. After 9/11, security procedures changed significantly. And then after the Boston Marathon bombing, it changed again, because the league required all teams to do metal detection.How long do the changeovers take, and how many people are involved? My guess is probably close to 100 people that are involved to switch things around. It really depends on how much time we have to get to the next event.The quickest turnaround that I recall was in 2013. We had a playoff game against the Tigers here, Game 2 of the American League division series on a Saturday and the game ended probably close to 10 p.m. that night and the Raiders had a game the next night at 8 p.m. I think they were done in somewhere around 12 hours.Anything you think you’d miss?I’ve been there my entire adult life there you know. So it’s been my life. So I’ll miss it because it’s really been my house for all these years. There’s people associated with the different teams that we share the facility with who won’t be there anymore.Do you have a favorite spot in the ballpark? For me personally, it would be right behind the backstop close to the dugout. And it is something that’s unique to only our ballpark. I don’t think there’s any ballpark left that has a walkway from the clubhouse to the dugout that you actually walk by fans.

Other Western “foreign fighters” can do the same. By Bryant Neal ViñasMr. Viñas was an American foreign fighter for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11.What do we do with Westerners who fought on behalf of, or at least traveled to and joined, the Islamic State? Some like Hoda Muthana, who left college in Alabama to join the Islamic State in Syria, have expressed the desire to return to their native country.As the Islamic State loses its last safe havens in eastern Syria and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic confront the question of what to do with the Western “foreign fighters,” I thought I could add my voice and unique experiences to the discussion.I was the first American foreign fighter for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11. I was captured in Pakistan, turned over to United States law enforcement and brought back to New York.I served time for my actions and have tried to make amends. Others can do the same and contribute to our society and the fight against Islamic radicals — and giving them that opportunity can set a powerful example for our allies and for vulnerable people across the world. Raised on Long Island and a convert to Islam, I traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fall of 2007 at age 24 because I was opposed to America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and went to defend Muslim lands from the West. It gave me a purpose, and my intention was to fight and die a martyr’s death on the battlefield as a brave Muslim warrior.After joining and fighting on behalf of some local fighting groups against American forces, I ultimately joined Al Qaeda. I was captured by Pakistani authorities in 2008 in Peshawar after training for months at Al Qaeda camps and participating in some military actions; I was subsequently turned over to American law enforcement and brought back to New York.Back in America, I ultimately made the decision to turn on my former fellow jihadists and help the United States fix, find and finish Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I also provided actionable intelligence to more than a dozen coalition partners. Though the federal judge who sentenced me described my cooperation as “remarkable,” I spent more than eight and a half years in federal prison; surprisingly, I can now say I am a better person because of it.This is where I think I can provide some advice. According to data tracked by the George Washington University Program on Extremism, as few as 59 Americans are known to have traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. Moreover, President Trump has said, “The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial.”I can say with confidence that arrest, full cooperation, contrition and the promise of rehabilitation can be a viable pathway forward for those Western foreign fighters who do not have “blood on their hands” — didn’t kill any coalition forces overseas — and are willing to admit they made mistakes and are ready to atone for them in prison.I went before the American judicial system and accepted my guilt when it came to the terrorism charges (conspiracy to murder United States nationals, providing material support to Al Qaeda and providing expert advice and assistance) against me. I also expressed my deepest apologies to the court and said that I would like “to turn a bad thing into a good thing.”There are citizens from the United States, Britain, Germany and France, men and women, who joined the Islamic State because of ideological fervor, the promise of adventure, the opportunity to create an Islamic utopia and a perceived religious obligation. It may be hard to see it this way, but they can be a strategic asset for the United States and our European partners.First, like me, they may have had an “insider view” and thus intelligence on how the Islamic State works and was organized, and maybe even leads on the whereabouts of its leadership. Second, these Westerners can provide insights on how they became radicalized and turned to extremism. And third, after they have done time in prison, thought about their decisions and made some peace with themselves about the consequences, they might even be, like me, willing to speak to vulnerable youth and impart to them their hard-earned wisdom.These former “terrorists” will have the legacy as volunteers who “went there and did it” and will be able to vouch that the experience of joining the caliphate wasn’t like the vision presented in slick videos on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Instead, joining a Sunni jihadist group overseas is a decision that you will have to live with for the rest of your life or will most likely be a quick trip with a dead end.But they will need some hope that there is life after terrorism. My life is good evidence that there is: Approximately a year ago, coming out of prison, I was on food stamps and unemployed. I can now report that not only am I no longer on food stamps, but I have a job and am thriving in the manufacturing industry.Moreover, I now speak to small audiences about my experiences as a former Al Qaeda member with the hope of better informing intelligence and law enforcement officials and analysts about what led me down this pathway, as well as how I deradicalized and became a contributing member of American society.The United States does not have any type of prison rehabilitation and re-entry program to prepare “formers” for life afterward with mental health services, vocational training or educational programs, but maybe I, and the few others like me who have changed our lives, can be role models for these foreign fighters.The United States can serve as an example for its allies — bring back the Americans who joined the Islamic State and let the American legal system do its work. After they serve the appropriate penalty under law for their actions, the country might even end up with a new counterterrorism resource.Bryant Neal Viñas was America’s first foreign fighter for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11 and now works with a counterextremism nonprofit, Parallel Networks.AdvertisementSupported byBy John KoblinCUPERTINO, Calif. — A delegation from Los Angeles trekked 300 miles to Apple’s campus armed with questions.Questions like: How much will viewers be charged for the coming slate of Apple programming? When will the shows be released? How will they be marketed?There were plenty of famous people onstage during the nearly two-hour presentation streamed live on Monday from the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., and plenty of skillful corporate stagecraft — but when it was all over, Hollywood’s main questions had gone unanswered.While entertainment veterans are rooting for the company to succeed in its new venture, they still need a little more convincing before they will endorse the notion that Apple has created “a new service dedicated to the best stories ever told,” as one of its executives, Jamie Erlicht, put it on Monday.In the first hour of the show, Apple played up its new brand identity as something other than a company that turned out hardware products by unveiling its news and gaming services. It also announced deals it had struck for programming from HBO, CBS, Showtime and Starz, as well as a credit card it had created with Goldman Sachs.The next act was the charm-and-dazzle portion of the program — Steven Spielberg! Oprah Winfrey! Big Bird! — during which Apple tried to get the word out to its customer base that it had become a major content company to rival Netflix or HBO.A secondary audience for the star-studded display was the entertainment industry itself, a group that included the producers, actors, executives and agents in the room, as well as their confreres monitoring the event from Los Angeles.Apple, which will house its original programming and shows from other companies in an app called Apple TV Plus, spent more than $1 billion on entertainment in the last year and a half. That expenditure brought a number of stars to the alien turf of Silicon Valley.The night before the 10 a.m. presentation, there was a cocktail party — no press invited — for many of the entertainment people now in business with the no-longer-just-a-tech company. The famous among them gathered for a Vanity Fair-style photo session. Art Streiber, a frequent celebrity portraitist for the magazine, shot group pictures in color and black and white. Ms. Winfrey was seated front and center, flanked by Jennifer Aniston and the Apple chief executive Tim Cook.The majority of the portrait subjects had outfitted themselves in the minimalist style long associated with the brand. The renegades included the “Aquaman” star Jason Momoa, who wore a wide-brimmed hat, and Jada Pinkett Smith, whose yellow skirt popped.Not long before the Monday showcase, the weekend arrivals were joined by the rest of the Hollywood contingent, who had jetted that morning to Cupertino, a city not known for its five-star accommodations. In flats, heels and black leather sneakers, they tramped up a hill on a cloudy, blustery morning. Youthful, cheerful Apple employees shouted out “Hello!” and “Good morning!”The agents, producers and executives stepped into the rounded glass space above the theater. It looked like an Apple Store, only grander, with no products on display, but plenty of coffee. “It’s time to begin the descent,” an Apple employee said, gesturing toward a stairwell as showtime approached.The Los Angeles crowd sat among Apple employees and others in the dark. They took in the information about Apple News Plus and the credit card. Then came the part of the show they had come to see.Mr. Spielberg, who is rebooting his 1980s-era NBC series “Amazing Stories” for Apple, had not appeared in the group portraits taken the night before, but he was the first member of the Hollywood envoy to take the stage.“This is my first time at Apple,” he said.He was followed by J. J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon, Ms. Aniston, Ms. Winfrey, and let’s not forget Big Bird, who was there to promote Apple’s plan to make children’s shows with Sesame Workshop, the maker of “Sesame Street.”While the presentation was something new for Apple, it was familiar to the audience members from Los Angeles. That’s because what they were seeing was essentially an upfront presentation.The so-called upfronts are a decades-old convention in the television business. Networks stage them for advertisers in Manhattan at Carnegie Hall, the Beacon Theater, and Radio City Music Hall. Stars take the spotlight to engage in scripted banter. Executives give rah-rah speeches. Skillfully edited clips raise hopes that the new shows will not be stinkers. Musicians and stand-up comics offer breaks in the action. Fall lineups are introduced with much fanfare.Despite the disruptive effect Apple promises to have on the entertainment industry, the company followed an old script on Monday. Mr. Spielberg talked up “Amazing Stories.” Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston promoted their drama, “The Morning Show,” and did some patter with their co-star, Steve Carell. The writer, actor, producer and comedian Kumail Nanjiani played up his anthology show about immigrants, “Little America.” The singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, introduced by Mr. Abrams, sat at a keyboard and sang the title theme to their musical series, “Little Voice.”When Apple’s heads of entertainment, the former Sony studio heads Mr. Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, hit the stage, there was thunderous applause as Hollywood cheered its own. A glimpse of their labors appeared in a one-minute, 43-second sizzle reel with clips from the coming programs. Apple hewed to the old timeline favored by traditional broadcast networks in announcing that the shows were “coming this fall.”A partial standing ovation greeted the celebrity saved for last: Ms. Winfrey. “There has never been a moment quite like this one,” she said, echoing the hyperbole that had been prevalent. She spoke of two documentaries, one on workplace sexual harassment, the other on mental health, and laid out plans for what sounded like an Apple-enhanced revival of the Oprah Book Club.Mr. Cook was the show’s closer. He paced before a black-and-white group portrait shot by Mr. Streiber the night before. It was projected behind him, the size of a mural. “They’ve impacted our culture, our society,” Mr. Cook said of its subjects, whom he praised as “these amazingly passionate and award-winning artists.”The lights went up and the members of the Hollywood group went out. Celebrities and sizzle reels were nothing new to them, so they were buzzing more about the new credit card than anything else. Made of titanium, with rounded edges and no pesky numbers to mar its face, it is likely to be a Beverly Hills status object. They also went on about the card because the event had not laid to rest their concerns about marketing, premiere dates and the cost of the streaming service to consumers.It was also not lost on them that, despite the impressive celebrity cavalcade, many of the stars on display were not exclusive to Apple. Mr. Spielberg has his own production company and makes deals freely. Ms. Witherspoon has shows with HBO and Hulu. Even Big Bird has ties to PBS and HBO.While skeptical, however, Hollywood is rooting for Apple. In addition to assuming the role of Medici-like patron, it is a viable competitor to Netflix, which can only be good for business. As Ms. Winfrey had put it, speaking of the worldwide reach of Apple’s devices, “They’re in a billion pockets, y’all. A billion pockets.”AdvertisementSupported bySure, it’s become a wellness fad. But it’s the best way I’ve found to keep digital monsters at bay. By Farhad ManjooOpinion ColumnistBecause I live in Northern California, where this sort of thing is required by local ordinance, I spent New Year’s Day at a meditation center, surrounded by hundreds of wealthy, well-meaning, Patagonia-clad white people seeking to restore order and balance to their tech-besotted lives. In the past, I might have mocked such proceedings, but lately I’ve grown fond of performative sincerity in the service of digital balance. It’s the people who haven’t resigned themselves to meditation retreats who now make me most nervous, actually.Which brings me to my point: It’s 2019. Why haven’t you started meditating, already? Why hasn’t everyone?I’ve been a technology journalist for nearly 20 years and a tech devotee even longer. Over that time, I’ve been obsessed with how the digital experience scrambles how we make sense of the real world. Technology may have liberated us from the old gatekeepers, but it also created a culture of choose-your-own-fact niches, elevated conspiracy thinking to the center of public consciousness and brought the incessant nightmare of high-school-clique drama to every human endeavor.It also skewed our experience of daily reality. Objectively, the world today is better than ever, but the digital world inevitably makes everyone feel worse. It isn’t just the substance of daily news that unmoors you, but also the speed and volume and oversaturated fakery of it all. A few years ago, I began to fear that the caustic mechanisms of the internet were eating away at my brain, turning me into an embittered, distracted, reflexively cynical churl. Since then, I’ve done everything I can to detox. I consulted app blockers and screen-time monitors to keep me offline. I even got my news from print newspapers in order to experience a slower, more deliberate presentation of media. But there are limits to the supposedly life-changing magic of going offline. Smartphones are as central to the economy as cars and credit cards, and a lot of people have little meaningful opportunity to quit. And the “offline” world is now ruled by what happens online. Escape is impossible. Quips on Twitter are indirectly programming cable news, and whatever lengths you might go to to shield your kid from the dark powers of phones, her social life will still rise and fall according to the inscrutable dynamics of Instagram and Fortnite. And so, to survive the brain-dissolving internet, I turned to meditation. Don’t roll your eyes. You’ve heard about the benefits of mindfulness before. Meditation has been rising up the ladder of West Coast wellness fads for several years and is now firmly in the zeitgeist. It’s the subject of countless books, podcasts, conferences, a million-dollar app war. It’s extolled by C.E.O.s and entertainers and even taught in my kids’ elementary school (again, it’s Northern California). The fad is backed by reams of scientific research showing the benefits of mindfulness for your physical and mental health — how even short-term stints improve your attention span and your ability to focus, your memory, and other cognitive functions. I knew all of this when I first began meditating a year ago, but I was still surprised at how the practice altered my relationship with the digital world. At first, it wasn’t easy: After decades of swimming in the frenetic digital waters, I found that my mind was often too scrambled to accommodate much focus. Sitting calmly, quietly and attempting to sharpen my thoughts on the present moment was excruciating. For a while, I flitted among several meditation books and apps, trying different ways to be mindful without pain. Then, about four months ago, I brute-forced it: I made meditation part of my morning routine and made myself stick with it. I started with 10 minutes a day, then built up to 15, 20, then 30. Eventually, something clicked, and the benefits became noticeable, and then remarkable. The best way I can describe the effect is to liken it to a software upgrade for my brain — an update designed to guard against the terrible way the online world takes over your time and your mind. Now, even without app blockers, I can stay away from mindless online haunts without worrying that I’m missing out. I can better distinguish what’s important from what’s trivial, and I’m more gracious and empathetic with others online. As far as I know, people are still wrong on the internet, but, amazingly, I don’t really care anymore.I can anticipate your excuses. First, this is all very old news: As Buddhists have known forever, meditation is really good for you, and The New York Times’s new Op-Ed columnist is On It. And second, it’s all a bit too woo-woo — it sounds promising, but you’re not one to go full Goop. Still, I hope you give it a try. I hope everyone does. (The Times’s David Gelles has written a great guide for getting started.) I’m not promising meditation will fix everything about how the internet has ruined you. AdvertisementSupported bynotedFor many office workers, “working from home” has replaced a day spent recovering under the covers. By Steven KurutzAdam Toren remembers the last time he crawled into bed, pulled the covers over his head and took off sick from work. “My whole family got wracked by the flu around 2006,” said Mr. Toren, a tech entrepreneur and writer. “Hopefully, that was the last time.”Thirteen years later, Mr. Toren, who lives in Phoenix, said he has not missed another day of work from illness, a streak of which he is exceedingly proud. To keep it going, “I monitor my sleep cycles,” he said, laying out the things he believes keep him healthy. “I don’t drink coffee. I drink specialty teas — Gyukuro, a Japanese tea. I take turmeric and resveratrol,” a supplement.Mr. Toren’s attendance streak may be an outlier, but more and more, the sick day is disappearing from the office vocabulary, even as we hit peak flu season. Once, a sick day was just that — a day away from work to focus on recovery (or at least pretend to: Think “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”). But in recent years, it has become something murkier in definition and more reflective of our highly competitive, 24-7 work lives. The shifting definition and expanding mobility of the office — thanks to remote work and the rise of contractors in the gig economy — is also making the sick day somewhat passé, at least for some jobs.  “Even if you take a sick day, you’re still emailing in the morning, checking in later in the day,” said Kit Warchol, the head of content marketing for Skillcrush, an online coding school. “It’s become more of a norm to write to your colleagues and tell them you’re working from home.”That’s what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did this week, when she was absent from the Supreme Court to hear arguments in a case while she recuperated from cancer surgery. She would participate from home, Chief Justice John Roberts said. Working from home may sound relaxing, but the “working” part of that phrase underscores the expectations that accompany it: being available to check and respond to email, hop on a conference call and generally be productive, even if you feel lousy. In a previous job, Ms. Warchol got the flu and found herself in a doctor’s waiting room. With idle time and a phone in her hands, she ended up doing email. “Smartphones have changed a lot of things,” she said.Skillcrush employees work remotely (Ms. Warchol lives in Los Angeles), and the company has a flexible hours policy. It does not have a firm limit on what have traditionally been called sick days, but rather depends on employees to responsibly manage their time and communicate with co-workers if they can’t work because of illness or other circumstances. When Ms. Warchol came down with a cold last fall, a few weeks after starting her job, that meant “writing in the morning, when I was fully awake and had just taken Dayquil. Then in the afternoon, I would let my team know on Slack that I was going dark a bit.”Ms. Warchol decided to work through her cold rather than face “the anxiety of falling too far behind,” she said, a nod to increased workloads as companies have downsized or cut back on hiring (or at firms in start-up mode).Some workers may be afraid to take a true sick day and seem dispensable to their employers. As Ms. Warchol said, “Will it be seen as a sign of a lack of loyalty or tenacity?” And freelancers who lack job security especially may also have such concerns. Mark J. Marsen, the director of human resources for Allies for Health & Well-Being, a Pittsburgh agency for those with H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases, said the sick day “is alive and well” at his company, although the semantics have changed.“We call them personal emergency days,” Mr. Marsen said. Broadening the definition gives employees greater privacy, Mr. Marsen said. It also takes into consideration mental health and whether a child or another family member who depends on the employee is sick and requires care. No longer does the employee have to “sell” their sickness to their boss with a list of symptoms.Personal days mean “you’re not able to do work today because of some circumstance,” Mr. Marsen said.Last month, Mr. Marsen caught a cold while traveling and missed two days of work. On the third day, he said, he felt well enough to work from home and checked his email, getting rid of the junk in his inbox. “That’s a life enhancer,” he said.But isn’t it unhealthy to never have a day to totally disconnect from your job and recover? Ms. Warchol, for one, appreciates the flexibility of the new model. In the barista position she took right out of college — and in many other jobs — working from home wasn’t an option. “It didn’t matter if I woke up with a sore throat. I was there at 6 a.m. making people’s coffee,” Ms. Warchol said. “There is a certain amount of privilege in not having to take sick days because you can work from your bed.”AdvertisementSupported byBEHIND THE BYLINE Interview by Lara TakenagaThe Reader Center has started a new series of short interviews, Behind the Byline, to introduce you to Times journalists.

What is most challenging about it?Sometimes there are these moments of vulnerability and honesty that happen in reporting, when the people I’m interviewing feel comfortable enough to open up about their lives. That is always an amazing gift and comes with a lot of responsibility. Those conversations make my work feel like a vocation. My job is about truth and, at the highest level, empathy. Everyone has a story that matters; some people are just never asked to share it. This job can be tough, though. As correspondents, our weeks and months can be unpredictable because we have to balance longer-term projects with breaking news. One week in November, to give an extreme example, my fellow California reporters and I went from covering the midterms on Tuesday, to a horrific shooting on Wednesday night, to wildfires on Thursday. There’s thematic whiplash, and it’s emotionally heavy. Our editors provide crucial support while we’re in the thick of it.And balancing work with my personal life can feel surreal at times. One Saturday during the wildfires, my partner, Patrick, found an open afternoon to propose after scouting a good day for weeks. By Monday I was on the southern border for a story. Do you ever feel emotionally overwhelmed when you’re reporting on tragedies? If so, how do you overcome that?On assignment, the part of my brain that can feel overwhelmed turns off. It must be adrenaline. On the ground, I’ve spoken to people minutes after they’ve seen their friends killed, or hours after their homes have burned down. I’ve spent a lot of time with people fighting addiction. Journalists have a responsibility to approach these situations with humility and humanity; that’s my priority, so there’s little room to dwell on my anxieties. Once I’m home or in my hotel room, that’s another thing. Journalists don’t talk enough about the effect that stress and adrenaline can have on our bodies, let alone on our mental health. I’m lucky to have a partner, family and friends who sustain me emotionally. I also have an informal support group at The Times, journalists with whom I check in regularly and vice versa. But I’d like for this to become a bigger conversation in newsrooms. How do you spend your time when you’re off duty? Off duty? El-Oh-El. I’m on the road a lot for work and persistently on call for breaking news. It’s exhilarating but a double-edged sword. I never imagined I’d see so much of this country. But being away from home so often, in many cases with little notice, can be tough. “Self-care” has become a hokey phrase, but I do believe in finding healthy ways to relieve stress. Some people I know practice meditation, but that hasn't worked for me. I subscribe to the “Just Dance” model of self-care. I try to start my days, at least when I’m on the road, with five-minute dance parties. Yes, by myself. Try it! They are extraordinarily rejuvenating. If you’re in a bad mood afterward, there’s nothing else I can do for you. The trick is making space for some joy and whimsy. That and a steady dose of exercise, novels and “Grey’s Anatomy” keep me sane. I also try to be mindful of how my work affects my partner. He has been inoculated against my schedule (we started dating while I was covering the Trump campaign). But just because he’s exceptionally supportive doesn’t mean I’m not responsible for him in return. When I’m home, we cook together, drink wine and listen to Linda Ronstadt, hike or visit art galleries. The biggest check on my “screen time” is my desire to maximize my time with him, friends and family, because I have no idea when I might need to bail. Ten minutes on Twitter are 10 wasted minutes. How has your background, as a gay man and the son of Mexican immigrants, informed your work?I’m always a little bit of an outsider wherever I am. I grew up in a trailer park in Anchorage. My parents don’t speak English and hustled hard to get by in the United States. They picked fruit when I was a baby in California. My dad fixed cars and washed dishes at restaurants. My mom cleaned rooms at a hotel for nearly two decades. I worked at that same hotel in high school.But that feels like a lifetime away now. I went to Harvard on scholarship. I work at The New York Times. My partner is a university professor. Reconciling my life then with my life now can be challenging but enlightening. I feel a responsibility to reflect a range of voices and communities in the articles I write. It’s not about a “Woke Checklist” — it’s about truth, about reflecting the world as it is and acknowledging our blind spots. That is why I’m so passionate about increasing diversity in newsrooms and making entry-level journalism jobs (and internships) financially realistic. I wasn’t always so comfortable sharing this stuff about my life, but I want journalists of color and from low-income backgrounds to know this career track is for them, too. If you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be? In college, I thought I might want to become an academic. During my sophomore year I fell in love with social theory. Reading Michel Foucault felt like having the veil lifted from my eyes. His ideas about power, systems and “regimes of truth” are extremely relevant today. I’ve also always had a profound affinity for archives. I sometimes wonder what I’d be up to if I were a historian. As a journalist, though, I get to work on the living, daily version of history. It’s such a gift.Illustration by Rebecca ClarkeA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.AdvertisementSupported byin her wordsSerena Williams’s new all-female Nike ad, “Dream Crazier,” hit on an issue almost as old as time: the “hysterical” woman. By Maya SalamWelcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.“If they want to call you crazy, fine. Show them what crazy can do.” — Serena Williams, in a new Nike ad about women in sportsThere is probably no better woman than Serena Williams to lead the charge of reclaiming the word “crazy.” In the past six months, she’s been penalized, fined and criticized for what she has said, has done, has worn and looks like — being called “crazy” by detractors all the while. Her ability to flourish in spite of it has further endeared her to her legion of supporters, so it was no surprise when fans went, well, crazy on Sunday night when Williams’s new all-female Nike ad, “Dream Crazier,” premiered during the Oscars. (It’s already racked up over six million views on YouTube.)The spot is a montage of some of the world’s greatest athletes doing what they do best, and defying authority while they do it. Williams, narrating, says women who express their emotions, their passion and their opinions have been called dramatic, nuts, delusional, unhinged, hysterical, irrational or crazy — seemingly reaching beyond the sports world to how women in all walks have been treated throughout time.Women being labeled hysterical or crazy as a way to degrade them dates back centuries. “Hysteria” — which comes from the Greek word for womb, hystera — was one of the first mental health conditions attributed to only women. “The idea was that any emotional display beyond the fairly tight boundaries of what was acceptable could be called hysteria,” Elaine Showalter, a feminist scholar who wrote an essay titled “Hysteria, Feminism and Gender,” told me this week. (For example, newly released letters revealed that Charles Dickens tried to have his wife, the mother of his 10 children, imprisoned in an asylum while he pursued an affair. He claimed his wife’s “excitability” as sufficient basis for “moral insanity,” which at the time it was.)[Sign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox.]The real politicization of the word, Showalter said, began around 1890 with the early suffrage movement and the rise of “the new woman”: an independent, challenging, confident, adventurous woman who laid claim to her emotions.“That’s what the ad was getting at,” said Showalter, who is professor emerita of English at Princeton University.During that time, hysterical and crazy were used mostly against two groups of women: those demanding entry to universities, particularly medical schools (“they’re going to overwork their brains” was an argument) and women who spoke publicly (they were seen as “abnormal, threatening and repulsive,” according to Showalter).“Speaking out in public was so taboo and considered so unfeminine, any form of it was denounced as hysterical,” Showalter said. Sound familiar? In 2017, Senator Kamala Harris was called “hysterical” by the former Trump aide Jason Miller for doing her job. (During a hearing, senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Harris, were each allotted time to ask Jeff Sessions, then attorney general, about his involvement with Russians during the 2016 election.) When pressed as to how she was hysterical, Miller replied, “I mean, she was asking some tough questions.” Serena Williams has long encouraged young women to assert themselves — echoing leaders of the past. Experienced suffragists would embolden younger women, Showalter said. “They’d say: ‘Don’t be afraid, you’re going to have to do it. You go out and speak in public, speak your mind and really say what you mean to say.’” [READ MORE: Women Are Penalized for Anger at Work, Especially Black Women]______If you watched Sunday’s Oscars ceremony, you probably caught the director Rayka Zehtabchi’s acceptance speech for her documentary “Period. End of Sentence.” — about the stigma of menstruation in a rural Indian village. “I’m not crying because I’m on my period,” Zehtabchi said. “I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar!”What you might have missed was that an anonymous Oscar voter called the movie “icky” on his ballot. The film is “well done, but it’s about women getting their period, and I don't think any man is voting for this film because it’s just icky for men,” he wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ______Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed.“I was a ‘me’ before #MeToo,” writes Lisa VanAllen, who testified against R.

This week in 1922, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the amendment was valid despite various efforts to discredit it. The challengers (namely Maryland, Tennessee and West Virginia) argued that the amendment had not been properly adopted or that it was unconstitutional. After the court’s ruling, Alice Paul, vice president of the National Woman’s Party, declared the decision a “final and complete official recognition of the victory of a 72-year campaign by the women of the United States.” Next up, she said, was the fight for equality in political office, marriage, property, wages and children.AdvertisementSupported byThere are no good alternatives to buspirone, so patients who rely on it are struggling.By Roni Caryn RabinA sudden shortage of one of the safest anti-anxiety drugs on the market has spread alarm among people who rely on the medication, buspirone, to get through the day without debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. Physicians are also expressing concern, because there is no information about when the supply will resume, making it difficult to manage patients.Shelby Vittek, a 27-year-old writer in New Jersey, fruitlessly called dozens of drugstores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in an attempt to locate the medication after her pharmacist told her the drug was on back-order with no end in sight. She ended up weaning herself off the drug, spreading her last three pills over six days to avoid having to go “cold turkey” before starting a difficult transition to an antidepressant. “I pretty much lost over a month of work, and have just started to feel like myself again,” she said.A 34-year-old New York woman who couldn’t get her buspirone refilled in January said she couldn’t sleep and had such severe panic attacks that she had to use Klonopin, a drug she dislikes because it is addictive. “I’m trying to take care of my anxiety, and it’s giving me a panic attack,” said the woman, a sexual assault survivor who asked not to be identified.A Pennsylvania medical school student received her mail-order shipment of medication last week with no buspirone in it and no explanation, so she scrounged around the house and dug up old pills from missed doses. Last weekend, the student, who asked not to be identified, was so anxious she could not leave the house.“This is potentially messing with people’s clinical stability,” said Dr. Dennis Glick, a psychiatrist in Greenbelt, Md. “When you have a patient with a complicated and balanced regimen, you really don’t want to just arbitrarily have someone come off the medicine.” Dr. Glick said he has been in practice for 34 years “and I honestly don’t recall issues like this interfering with care until maybe a couple of years ago.”Persistent shortages have plagued hundreds of drugs in recent years, from morphine to intravenous fluids, and many psychiatric medications used to treat schizophrenia, as well as some stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are in short supply. Some of the worst shortages are of generic, or non-brand-name, drugs like buspirone, whose prices have been driven so low that many manufacturers say they cannot turn a profit on them.One in five Americans has had an anxiety disorder in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, though relatively few use buspirone, and doctors are of mixed opinions about its effectiveness. But experts say it is a much safer drug than the benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drugs like Valium and Xanax and is unlikely to cause harm from an overdose or when combined with other medications like opioids. It is not addictive, has few side effects, does not cause sexual dysfunction and is remarkably inexpensive.It can also be used to augment antidepressants and help to alleviate sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants.And it’s almost impossible to replace with an alternative drug because unlike the S.S.R.I. antidepressants, for example, where there are five or six options, there is no equivalent medication that works the same way. “Buspirone is in a class by itself. It occupies a unique niche,” said Dr. Elias Aboujaoude, a clinical professor and chief of the anxiety disorders section at Stanford University School of Medicine.For a patient with anxiety and a history of depression, conditions that often overlap, “you may want to avoid a benzo because they can also be depressants, and buspirone can be a safer, more reasonable option,” he said.Patients also do not have the choice of paying more to buy the brand-name version of buspirone, Buspar, because it is no longer made.Buspirone prescriptions dispensed in the United States rose to 13.5 million in 2017 from 10.2 million in 2015, with the number estimated to reach nearly 15 million last year, according to IQVIA, a health care technology and data analytics provider. The reasons for the increase are unclear, though the opioid epidemic may have made some physicians more reluctant to prescribe highly addictive anti-anxiety medications that can be lethal when combined with opioids.The main reason for the buspirone shortage appears to be interrupted production at a Mylan Pharmaceuticals plant in Morgantown, W.Va., which produced about a third of the country’s supply of the drug. The Food and Drug Administration had said the facility was dirty and that the company failed to follow quality control procedures.Mylan has told the F.D.A. the date for resuming buspirone production is “T.B.D.”“Companies don’t have to tell the F.D.A. how long the shortage is going to last or when they expect it to be back,” making planning difficult for doctors and patients to manage, said Erin Fox, senior pharmacy director at University of Utah Health and director of its Drug Information and Support Services.Most drug manufacturing plants are already running at full capacity so “when one shuts down even for a short period of time, there is no resiliency in the supply chain for anyone else to make up the difference,” Dr. Fox said.Rock bottom prices for some generic drugs are also contributing to the crisis. Consolidation among wholesalers has led to the creation of three buying consortium behemoths that purchase 90 percent of the generic pharmaceutical products in the United States, said Adam Fein, a consultant and chief executive of Drug Channels Institute. These “monster” buyers have squeezed manufacturers on prices, and “some of those generic manufacturers are deciding the profit is so low they can’t make money, and they’re exiting the category,” Dr. Fein said.AdvertisementSupported byBy Vivian Wang and Jesse McKinley [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]ALBANY — New York lawmakers on Tuesday approved the most comprehensive set of gun bills in the state in six years, including measures that would ban bump stocks, prohibit teachers from carrying guns in schools and extend the waiting period for gun buyers who do not pass an instant background check.In total, six gun bills passed easily through the State Senate and Assembly, a remarkable sight in a Capitol that for years had resisted almost all new legislation on the subject.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, last ushered a major gun safety package into law in 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The governor successfully corralled recalcitrant Senate Republicans into supporting the so-called Safe Act that expanded the state’s ban on assault weapons, tightened certification requirements, increased criminal penalties for illegal guns and closed private sale loopholes.Mr. Cuomo has described the Safe Act as one of his signature achievements. But it has also become a rallying cry for some gun owners and Republican politicians who felt it overreached.“Sometimes history irrefutably bears out your actions,” the governor said on Tuesday, at a news conference lined with gun safety advocates. “Today is the next evolution in this ongoing crusade.”The relative ease of the laws’ passage highlighted, for the second time in just two days, the upheaval that November’s election brought to Albany. Democrats captured the Senate for the first time in a decade, delivering one-party control of state government. Since the legislative session began this month, both chambers have sent long-stymied bills in rapid-fire procession to the governor’s desk.On Monday, for example, a bill to protect child sex abuse victims sailed through the Legislature, 13 years after its introduction. The Senate, which under Republican rule never allowed the bill to reach the floor for a vote, unanimously approved it.Tuesday’s marquee gun bills passed largely along partisan lines. No Republican senators voted to extend the waiting period for completing background checks to 30 days from three. Just one voted for the proposal to ban arming teachers.The most debated item was a so-called red flag bill, which would allow family members, school officials or law enforcement to ask courts to temporarily block someone from buying or owning a gun, if the judge decided that person posed a potential risk.That provision in particular drew an emotional response from Linda Beigel Schulman, whose son, Scott, grew up on Long Island and was teaching at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. during the massacre there last year; he was killed while helping students flee the shooter.“Parkland would’ve never happened if they had a red flag law,” Ms. Schulman said while sitting alongside Mr. Cuomo, adding that one of the killer’s former teachers told her that the shooter had showed disturbing tendencies.Senator Brian Kavanagh, a Democrat from New York City who sponsored the bill, said the number of New York state residents who die each year — 772 in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — because of guns “is unacceptable.” He added: “It’s also preventable.”California, Washington, Indiana and Connecticut have similar provisions to keep guns away from high-risk people.Republicans suggested the bill would allow people to randomly curtail Second Amendment rights for many New Yorkers.“Today’s actions infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens,” said Senator Pamela Helming, from Central New York.The bill ultimately passed the Senate 42-21, and the Assembly 83-32.A few proposals did earn Republican votes: those that would establish a gun buyback program, and that would prohibit the sale of bump stocks, which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts. A bill allowing New York regulators to access mental health records for out-of-state gun buyers passed nearly unanimously.The governor acknowledged that strengthening New York’s gun laws could invite legal challenges from gun advocacy groups and activists, given the conservative tilt of the Supreme Court. The high court’s justices recently announced that they would review a New York City gun law, the court’s first Second Amendment case in nearly a decade.Several Republicans accused Democrats of grandstanding by pushing laws that already exist; for example, President Trump imposed a federal ban on bump stocks last year after the mass murder of 58 people in Las Vegas. (The ban is regulatory, however, not statutory, and several groups have announced their intention to challenge it in court.)Mr. Cuomo, a frequent and favorite antagonist of the National Rifle Association, has been accused of politicizing gun control for his own benefit. But he also has a long record of fighting for stricter gun regulations, and he has frequently pointed out that his public support, especially upstate, never fully recovered after passage of the Safe Act.On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the Legislature also made their antipathy to widespread gun use clear.“I personally don’t agree with it, but I respect it,” the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, said of the Second Amendment.Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader, promised further action in the coming months. The only other major gun legislation passed since the Safe Act was a law last year to take guns away from domestic abusers.“It will not be six years, believe me, between sensible gun laws,” she said.AdvertisementSupported bythe new old ageAs residents become older and more frail, some facilities are bringing in doctors and nurses instead of relying on 911.By Paula SpanThe patient moved into a large assisted living facility in Raleigh, N.C., in 2003. She was younger than most residents, just 73, but her daughter thought it a safer option than remaining in her own home.The woman had been falling so frequently that “she was ending up in the emergency room almost every month,” said Dr. Shohreh Taavoni, the internist who became her primary care physician.“She didn’t know why she was falling. She didn’t feel dizzy — she’d just find herself on the floor.” At least in a facility, her daughter told Dr. Taavoni, people would be around to help.As the falls continued, two more in her first three months in assisted living, administrators followed the policy most such communities use: The staff called an ambulance to take the resident to the emergency room.There, “they would do a CT scan and some blood work,” Dr. Taavoni said. “Everything was O.K., so they’d send her back.”Such ping-ponging occurs commonly in the nation’s nearly 30,000 assisted living facilities, a catchall category that includes everything from small family-operated homes to campuses owned by national chains.It’s an expensive, disruptive response to problems that often could be handled in the building, if health care professionals were more available to assess residents and provide treatment when needed.But most assisted living facilities have no doctors on site or on call; only about half have nurses on staff or on call. Thus, many symptoms trigger a trip to an outside doctor or, in too many cases, an ambulance ride, perhaps followed by a hospital stay.Twenty years after the initial boom in assisted living — which now houses more than 800,000 people — that approach may be shifting.Early on, assisted living companies planned to serve fairly healthy retirees, offering meals, social activities and freedom from home maintenance and housekeeping — the so-called hospitality model. But from the start, the assisted living population was older and sicker than expected. Now, most residents are over age 85, according to government data. About two-thirds need help with bathing, half with dressing, 20 percent with eating.Like most older Americans, they also generally contend with chronic illnesses and take long lists of prescription drugs — and more than 80 percent need help taking them correctly.Moreover, “these places became the primary residential setting for people with dementia,” said Sheryl Zimmerman, an expert on assisted living at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. About 70 percent of residents have some degree of cognitive impairment, her studies have found. So residents can find it difficult to coordinate medical appointments and tests, and to travel to offices and labs, even when facilities provide a van.“The assisted living industry has to recognize that the model of residents going out to see their own doctors hasn’t worked for a long time,” said Christopher Laxton, executive director of AMDA, a society that represents health care professionals in nursing homes and assisted living.His recent editorial in McKnight’s Senior Living, an industry publication, was pointedly headlined: “It’s time we integrate medical care into assisted living.” AMDA is considering developing model agreements.“There has to be more attention to medical and mental health care in assisted living,” Dr. Zimmerman agreed. “Does everyone who falls really need to go to an emergency department?”Lindsay Schwartz, an executive at the National Center for Assisted Living, a trade association, said in an email that “assisted living has certainly expanded its role in providing medical care over the years by adding nursing staff and partnering with other health care providers, among other ways.”But persuading most operators to provide medical care likely won’t happen without a fight. They’ve built their marketing strategies on looking and feeling different from the dreaded nursing home, and they object to “medicalizing” their communities.“They don’t want the liability,” said Dr. Alan Kronhaus, an internist who, with Dr. Taavoni (they are married), started a practice called Doctors Making Housecalls in 2002. The facilities also “live in mortal fear of bringing down heavy-handed federal regulation,” he said. That can happen when Medicare and Medicaid, which cover most residents’ health care, get involved.Doctors Making Housecalls provides one example of how assisted living can offer medical care. The practice dispatches 120 clinicians — 60 doctors, plus nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and social workers — to about 400 assisted living facilities in North Carolina.“We see patients often, at length and in detail, to keep them on an even keel,” Dr. Kronhaus said. By contracting with labs, imaging companies and pharmacies, the practice can provide most of the medical care for more than 8,000 residents, on site and around the clock. Working with a local emergency medical service, he and his colleagues reported in a 2017 study that the practice could reduce emergency room transfers by two-thirds.The Lott Assisted Living Residence in Manhattan, on the other hand, relies on a single geriatrician, Dr. Alec Pruchnicki, to provide medical care for most of its 127 or so residents.If they’re feeling sick, a family member calls or the resident just knocks on the door of “Dr. P’s” basement office. “Sometimes it’s just a cold — chicken soup,” Dr. Pruchnicki said. “But this winter we had a few cases of flu and pneumonia, things you need to treat.”Nearby Mount Sinai Hospital employs him and provides emergency services when needed. Often, they’re not. In 2005, Dr. Pruchnicki reported at medical conferences, he decreased hospitalizations by a third. “I can’t be in the only place in the country where this would work,” he said.Spending time in emergency rooms and hospitals often takes a toll on residents, even if their ailments can be treated. They get exposed to infections and develop delirium; they lose strength from days spent in bed.Perhaps that contributes to short stays in assisted living. Adult children often see these facilities as their parents’ final homes, but residents stay just 27 months on average, after which many move on to nursing homes.Adding doctors to assisted living could also cause problems, advocates acknowledge; in particular, it might increase the already high fees facilities charge.But something has clearly got to give. “There can be health care in assisted living without making it feel like a nursing home,” Dr. Zimmerman said.Family members tell of frightened and confused residents arriving unaccompanied at emergency rooms, unable to give clear accounts of their problems. Dr. Kronhaus recalls a resident with dementia taken to the local E.R. by ambulance; discharged, she was sent home by taxi. The address she gave the driver was her former home, where neighbors spotted her and called the police.By contrast, the North Carolina woman with a history of falls is doing well. AdvertisementSupported byResearch suggests that the challenges aren’t a series of single strands, but a spider web of them.By Neil IrwinIf a group of time-traveling economists were to visit from the year 2000 and wanted to know how the economy had changed since their time, what would you tell them?You might mention that economic growth has been slower than it used to be across much of the advanced world, and global inflation and interest rates have been lower. An aging population is changing the demographics of the work force. Productivity growth has been weak. Inequality has risen. And the corporate world is more and more dominated by a handful of “superstar” firms.The time-traveling economists would find that list rather depressing, but also would tend to view each problem on the list as discrete, with its own cause and potential solutions. “What terrible economic luck,” they might say, “that all those things happened at the same time.”But what if those megatrends are all the same problem?Maybe, for example, inequality is contributing to weak growth and low rates because the rich tend to save money rather than spend it. Maybe productivity has been weak not by coincidence, but because weak growth has meant companies haven’t been forced to innovate to meet demand. Perhaps industry concentration has left companies with more power to set wages, resulting in more inequality and lower inflation.Those theories may not be definitively proven, but there is growing evidence supporting each. Much of the most interesting economic research these days is trying to understand and prove potential connections between these dysfunctions.In recent weeks, for example, one groundbreaking paper proposes that low interest rates are fueling a rising concentration of major industries and low productivity growth. Another offers evidence that aging demographics are an important factor in weak productivity.Even if you don’t fully buy every one of these interrelationships, taken together, this work suggests we’ve been thinking about the world’s economic woes all wrong. It’s not a series of single strands, but a spider web of them.Imagine a person with a few separate problems — some credit card debt, say, and an unhappy marriage. That person might be able to address each problem on its own, by paying down debt and going to counseling.But things are thornier when a person has a long list of problems that are interrelated. Think of someone with mental health problems, a drug addiction, and an inability to maintain family relationships or hold a job. For that person you can’t just fix one thing. It’s a whole basket of problems.The implication of this new body of research is that the global economy, like that troubled person, needs a lot of different types of help all at the same time.But for now, the challenge is just to understand it.Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton, was recently having dinner with a colleague whose parents owned a small hotel in Spain. The parents had complained vociferously, Mr. Mian recalled the friend saying, about the European Central Bank’s low interest rate policies.That didn’t make sense, Mr. Mian thought. After all, low interest rates should make it easier for small business owners to invest and expand; that’s one of the reasons central banks use them to combat economic weakness.The owners of the small hotel didn’t see it that way. They thought that big hotel chains were the real beneficiaries of low interest rate policies, not a mom-and-pop operation.Mr. Mian, along with his Princeton colleague Ernest Liu and research partner, Amir Sufi at the University of Chicago, tried to figure out if the relationship between low interest rates and business investment might be murkier than textbooks suggested.Imagine a town in which two hotels are competing for business, one part of a giant chain and one that is independent. The chain hotel might have some better technology and marketing to give it a steady advantage, and is therefore able to charge a little more for its rooms and be a little more profitable. But it is basically a level playing field.When interest rates fall to very low levels, though, the payoff for being the industry leader rises, under the logic that a business generating a given flow of cash is more valuable when rates are low than when they are high. (This is why low interest rates typically cause the stock market to rise.)A market leader has more to gain from investing and becoming bigger, and it becomes less likely that the laggards will ever catch up.“At low interest rates, the valuation of market leaders rises relative to the rest,” Mr. Mian said. “Amazon becomes a lot more valuable as interest rates fall relative to a smaller player in the same industry, and that gives a huge advantage to Amazon.”In turn, the researchers argue, that can cause smaller players to underinvest, lowering productivity growth across the economy. And that can create a self-sustaining cycle in which industry leaders invest more and achieve ever-rising dominance of their industry.The researchers tested the theory against historical stock market data since 1962, and found that falling interest rates indeed correlated with market leaders that outperformed the laggards.“There’s a view that we can solve all of our problems by just making interest rates low enough,” Mr. Mian said. “We’re questioning that notion and believe there is something else going on.”In another effort to apply a new lens on how major economic forces may interact, economists at Moody’s Analytics have tried to unpack the ties between demographic change and labor productivity.No one disputes that the aging of the current work force is reducing growth rates. With many in the large baby boom generation retiring, fewer people are working and producing, which directly reduces economic output.In terms of company efficiency, though, you could imagine that an aging work force could cut in either direction. Savvy, more experienced workers might be able to generate more output for every hour they work. But they might be less willing to learn the latest technology or adapt their work style to changing environments. Adam Ozimek, Dante DeAntonio and Mark Zandi analyzed data on work force age and productivity at both the state and industry level, with payroll data on millions of workers. They found that the second effect seems to prevail, that an aging work force can explain a slowdown in productivity growth of between 0.3 and 0.7 percentage points per year over the last 15 years.Mr. Ozimek says companies may not want to invest in new training for people in their early 60s who will retire in a few years. “It’s possible that older workers may still be the absolute best workers at their firms, but it could be not worth it to them or the company to retrain and learn new things,” he said.The research implies there could be a downward drag on productivity growth for years to come.These findings are hardly the end of the discussion on these topics. But they do reflect that there can be a lot of nonintuitive connections hiding in plain sight.AdvertisementSupported byBy Catherine PorterTORONTO — She wants to go to college to study architecture.

She is wondering about how to harness her newfound media stardom.But mostly, the celebrated Saudi-turned-Canadian-refugee Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun just wants to experience what it is like to be a teenager, free to do what she wants and dress how she wants.“I want to do crazy things I’ve never done before,” she said in an interview Monday evening, sitting in a classroom at a refugee center in downtown Toronto.On just her third day in Canada, Ms. Alqunun, 18, seemed to be still a bit stunned.In less than two weeks, she has gone from the cloistered life of a Saudi woman in Hail, a city in the northwestern part of the country, to the life of an independent woman on the other side of the world.Now she can do things unimaginable for a woman at home.“From the welcome I had and love I’ve been shown, I saw this is a country that respects human rights and the dignity of a person,” Ms. Alqunun said through an interpreter. “It’s also cold.”(It was 30 degrees Fahrenheit in Toronto on Monday — 38 degrees colder than in Hail.)Ms. Alqunun became a social media sensation, and a cause célèbre for the rights of women and refugees, after fleeing her family on Jan. 5 while they were on holiday in Kuwait.Freed from the restrictions on women’s movement back home in Saudi Arabia, and using a friend's credit card, she bought a ticket for a flight to Australia with a layover in Bangkok — where Thai officials said they would send her back home.Ms. Alqunun spent six nights holed up in a Bangkok airport hotel, opened a new Twitter account and mounted a campaign for asylum. “I’m afraid, my family WILL kill me,” she tweeted, adding later that her family had threatened to kill her before and considered her “as property or their slave.”Furthering her danger, she renounced Islam on Twitter. “They will kill me because I fled and because I announced my atheism. They wanted me to pray and to wear a veil, and I didn’t want to.”International outrage over the attempts to send her back to Saudi Arabia quickly mounted.Although Ms. Alqunun had planned to fly on to Australia, the Canadian government granted her asylum. On Saturday morning, she arrived at the Toronto airport, where she was greeted by the Canadian foreign minister and a phalanx of reporters.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]In Saudi Arabia, Ms. Alqunun was a first-year university student, studying basic science and math. One of 10 children of a well-off emir, she said that life had been financially comfortable, but that she had no freedom.Things grew even harder, she said, when her father left the city and put her under the guardianship of her older brother. She described her life as one of strict rules and abuse at the hands of her family. After she cut her hair in a way her family did not approve, her brother locked her in a room for six months, she said. A few months ago, when she removed her niqab, he beat her and locked her up again, she said.After days of silence, the first comments about the case have emerged from Saudi Arabia. In a statement, the head of the Saudi government-funded National Society for Human Rights accused countries of inciting “Saudi female delinquents” to rebel against their family values and seek asylum. He called the actions political, not humanitarian.The case is sure to further fray relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, which have been strained since last summer, when Canada’s foreign affairs ministry posted two Twitter messages calling for the release of imprisoned rights activists in Saudi Arabia. In response, the kingdom expelled the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh, recalled the Saudi ambassador to Ottawa, froze all new trade and investment deals, and ordered thousands of Saudi students studying in Canada to transfer elsewhere.The Canadian government, however, did not back down.Canada accepts tens of thousands of refugees a year, but few have Ms. Alqunun’s stardom or powerful, if newly formed, network. In just over one week, she has garnered 176,000 Twitter followers, forged relationships with human rights activists and been on the front pages of newspapers around the world.No fewer than three GoFundMe campaigns have been launched in her name, raising more than $12,900 (17,200 Canadian dollars) already.Fame has come with its price though. She has received death threats online, credible enough for refugee settlement workers to provide her with security.And Ms. Alqunun says she misses the kinship with her sisters, and worries that her family will take out its anger on her younger sister, who is still at home.Ms. Alqunun had once hoped simply to fashion a normal life. Now, she is contemplating whether she should put her unexpected platform to use.“I have a lot of followers,” she said. “My voice is heard. Maybe I can do something with it.”But first, she will need to do some basics. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for a year — and free English classes.Over the next few weeks, refugee settlement workers will also help her get health insurance, a social insurance number and bank account. They will help her find an apartment and furnish it.But Ms. Alqunun will have to learn how to go grocery shopping, and navigate the city on the bus and subway by herself — the sort of things she has never experienced before.“It’s like moving from one planet to another. Nothing is the same,” said one Canadian women’s rights activist, Yasmine Mohammed, who helped raise more than $7,600 for Ms. Alqunun. “She has to focus on herself and her mental health before she tries to help other people out.”AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerBy Rory SmithLIVERPOOL, England — Friday morning, and Goodison Park is quiet. There are no fans milling around the streets outside, spilling out of the Winslow pub, eagerly rushing to their seats. There is no noise, no color, no riot of blue and white. There are only a handful of cars in the parking lot. It is spitting with rain.A stadium is a home, but that is, in truth, only an occasional role. These are places that blossom only every other weekend, as Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby. For much of the rest of the time, though, a stadium is dormant, quiet: an empty, expectant shell.The day-to-day life of a club — the parts of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer, and the parts of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere. For Everton, the former is at Finch Farm, its training facility on the eastern fringes of Liverpool. The latter is in the Liver Buildings, on the city’s sparkling waterfront, where Everton relocated its offices last year, a new home for all those departments whose job it is to sell shirts and tickets and sponsorship deals. To most fans, a club is a team, hopefully to win games. To all owners, a club is a business, hopefully to make money.A club is more than that, though; there is another side, one which does its work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of offices in the city, but in the tight warren of terraced streets that surround the stadium, in schools across Liverpool, in some of the most underprivileged parts of Merseyside.Across the street from Goodison Park, a group of children are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small, artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage, built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton’s community hub. Inside, teenagers mill and mingle with teachers and coaches in Everton polo shirts.Around the corner, in what was once a run-down working men’s club, a few dozen retirees are spending the morning cycling through their memories — of Everton, of the city — over tea and cake. Pat van den Hauwe, a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s, is helping serve the coffee.On Goodison Road, the club has bought three houses and converted them into drop-in centers, safe spaces for anyone who feels they need a place to go. Their doors are always open. There is always someone to talk to. There is always food in the fridge.All clubs run outreach programs, of course, and employ staff members to work in the communities they call home. But few, if any, can match Everton’s for size and scope. The buildings that house Everton in the Community cost more than $10 million to develop; the program’s annual budget is around $4 million. It has 125 staff members and 145 volunteers. It works in more than 200 locations: schools, youth clubs, community centers.There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield, Liverpool’s stadium, and among the most deprived areas in Britain — that the club does not touch.It oversees more than 40 social programs, focused on issues as diffuse as mental health and serious organized crime; it reaches more than 20,000 people a year. Last year, Everton won a grant of 700,000 pounds, or about $925,000, to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture. It has a presence in 150 schools. In September 2015, it became the first club to launch its own school.Everton has, for more than a decade, styled itself as Liverpool’s People’s Club, a term popularized by David Moyes, its former manager, to distinguish it from its near neighbor. Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park; scarves embossed with the slogan can be bought from stands around the stadium on match day.“Our fans hold us up against that image,” Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said. “They expect us to live up to it. It is not a corporate social responsibility program. It is long-term, strategic work. It is a huge component of what Everton is.” So substantial, in fact, that before she was promoted to running Everton last year, Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club, or its merchandising arm, but its community department.It is not just the scale of Everton’s work that marks it as different, though; it is the scope of it, too. Everton goes into areas other clubs — and other charities, even — might find “intimidating,” as Barrett-Baxendale put it. Sue Gregory, Everton in the Community’s director of youth engagement, recalls representatives of other teams marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory, just a soccer club — was prepared to work with convicted criminals, drug dealers, members of gangs. “You could see it as the club risking its brand,” she said.Barrett-Baxendale does not. “We work on these issues because these issues exist on the streets of Merseyside,” she said. It is a view supported throughout the club. At the start of the season, Everton’s players signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work. A copy of it hangs on a wall in the Community’s hub. There have been times that players have had to be reminded to leave after sessions there: Tom Davies, the midfielder, once insisted he was happy to stay for as long as possible at one session because he was busy “coloring in unicorns.”Gregory, her staff and her volunteers know how much all of that matters. They hear all of the stories: the teenagers forced to work selling drugs for gangs to settle their parents’ debts, or chased through the streets for punishment beatings; the boys sent hundreds of miles from home as part of the “county lines” phenomenon, in which city gangs seek to control the drug market in smaller towns; the children who stock up on food at the sessions because there is not enough to eat at home.Everton does not have a choice, in other words, but to confront those problems. Shying away from them would make all the work it does nothing but tokenism. “This is our community,” Gregory said, adding: “These are the issues our community faces. There is a culture of ‘let’s try.’”Wherever it can, it makes the most of the power of its crest: The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert’s Tower, instantly recognizable, is part of the city’s civic scenery. It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fans are part of the Everton programs — and represents, instead, permanence.“People trust the badge,” said Richard Kenyon, Everton in the Community’s chief executive. “They respond to it in a really powerful way. They’re drawn to it.”Those who would normally eschew authority figures, those who would not respond to local government or a school principal, respond to that crest. Everton, they know, is not going anywhere.“We are a consistent presence,” Gregory said. “Kids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year, but then they move on, and the kids lose that. We are always there, so that bond is not lost.”This, more than the team or the business, is what a club is, what a club can do. Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community’s smallest projects: a little corner of scrap land that has been converted into an herb garden. The plot is little more than a postage stamp. When Everton started it, encouraging children from these streets to tend to it, some worried that it would be ruined, vandalized, maybe even in its first few days. That was months ago. It is still pristine.Follow Rory Smith on Twitter: @RorySmith.AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert PearWASHINGTON — Democrats, claiming a mandate from voters, opened a legislative campaign on Wednesday to secure protections under the Affordable Care Act for people with pre-existing medical conditions, putting aside divisions over a more ambitious push for “Medicare for all” in favor of shoring up existing law.“Health care was the single most important issue to voters in the 2018 election,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, as she convened a hearing on a decision by a federal district judge in Texas that would invalidate the entire law.In the court case, filed by Texas and 19 other states, the Trump administration has refused to defend provisions of the Affordable Care Act that protect people with pre-existing conditions.On the day of the court decision in December, President Trump hailed it as “Great news for America!”But in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he said it was now important “to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.” More than any other issue, health care was the policy that united Democratic campaigns last fall, specifically a promise to protect existing law that prohibits insurance companies from charging higher premiums or blocking coverage for customers with pre-existing medical conditions.Now in charge of the House, Democrats are divided over how far and how fast to go to expand health insurance coverage — and whether to push for a single, government-run system like Medicare for all. But some lawmakers have expressed impatience with the pace of legislative efforts on the one issue they agree on: protecting pre-existing condition coverage.Experts and ordinary citizens told Congress on Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s position in the Texas court case could be devastating to some patients.“Families like mine — families with medically complex children — are terrified of what this lawsuit may mean for our kids,” said Elena Hung, whose 4-year-old daughter was born with chronic medical conditions that affect her lungs, heart and kidneys.“Our lives are already filled with uncertainty — about diagnoses, the effects of medications and the outcomes of surgeries,” said Ms. Hung, who helped found a child advocacy group called Little Lobbyists. “The one certainty we have is the Affordable Care Act and the protections it provides.”The priorities of the new House majority were on display on Wednesday as three subcommittees held hearings to investigate Mr. Trump’s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the last two years.Democrats said they would try to strengthen the law and restore funds cut by the Trump administration for insurance counselors who help people enroll in health plans. They said they would also try to prevent the White House from granting waivers to state insurance programs that skirt the Affordable Care Act.Representative Lauren Underwood, a freshman Democrat from Illinois, introduced a bill to increase protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Ms. Eshoo, the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health, said she would hold a hearing on it next week.The bill would overturn a Trump administration rule that has allowed the proliferation of short-term health insurance policies. The policies are allowed to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. And they often omit coverage of prescription drugs, mental health care and other benefits guaranteed as essential by the Affordable Care Act.“A pre-existing condition shouldn’t be some kind of scarlet letter Americans have to wear around their neck as they try to get the quality, affordable health care everyone deserves,” Ms. Underwood said.Ms. Underwood, a nurse, has a pre-existing condition that occasionally prevents her heart from maintaining a normal rhythm. “So this is personal,” she said. “No insurer should ever have the option to discriminate against us.”For their part, Republicans said they, too, supported protections for people with pre-existing conditions and wanted to work with Democrats on the issue. But Republican proposals in the past have sometimes offered less protection than the Affordable Care Act provides. They would, for example, have prevented insurers from raising premiums for people with pre-existing conditions — but only if consumers maintained “continuous coverage” without a significant interruption.A lapse in coverage could have allowed insurers to significantly raise premiums for the sick.Republicans searched for divisions between Democrats hoping to shore up the Affordable Care Act and more progressive members pushing for a single, government-run insurance system. They taunted Democrats by demanding a public hearing on Democratic proposals for a single-payer health care system, known increasingly as Medicare for all.“The American people should hear how House Democrats expect to address the massive costs associated with Medicare for all,” said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee. “They need to know about the $32 trillion price tag for such a plan and the tax increases necessary to pay for it.”Some Medicare-for-all proposals could end employer-sponsored health plans that now cover more than 150 million people, Mr. Walden said.One-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed proposals to open Medicare to all Americans, as have some of the party’s presidential candidates.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said it was hypocritical for Republicans to seek hearings on Medicare for all, a plan they oppose as a government takeover of health care.“Who are you kidding?” Mr. Pallone asked the Republicans. “You’re saying that you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then you want to have a hearing on Medicare for all. The cynicism of it!”At a separate hearing, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said the ruling in the Texas case posed a serious threat to people with employer-sponsored coverage.“All Americans, whether insured through an A.C.A. marketplace or through their employer, would lose the consumer protections we all take for granted,” Mr. Scott said.Under the Affordable Care Act, employers generally cannot impose a waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions. The law requires employers to cover health screenings and other preventive services at no cost to employees, and it prohibits annual and lifetime limits on benefits.Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida and a former secretary of health and human services, said that Republicans, “despite their long assault on the Affordable Care Act, have yet to develop an alternative that would continue to safeguard more than 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.”California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision in the Texas case by Judge Reed O’Connor of Federal District Court in Fort Worth.AdvertisementSupported byBy Richard SandomirBarbara Hammer, an experimental filmmaker who began celebrating lesbian sexuality and history in her work in the 1970s, and who in her last years turned her battle against cancer into cinematic art, died on Saturday in her partner’s home in Manhattan. She was 79.Florrie Burke, her partner, said the cause was endometrioid ovarian cancer.Ms. Hammer’s filmmaking took a radical turn in 1970 when she came out as a lesbian. She was 30 and divorced from her husband when her first female lover helped her rediscover herself.“Her leg touched my own and I felt this incredible rush — erotic rush — just through our knees, and I thought, ‘Oh, my God, I’ve never felt this for a woman before,’ ” she said in an oral history interview for the Smithsonian Archives of American Art last year. “And I decided right then I can act on this or ignore it. I decided to act on it.”Beside her lover at Ms. Hammer’s home in Santa Rosa, Calif., she recalled, “I became a lesbian.”Her epiphany catapulted her into directing films that let her explore her life and those of other lesbians decades before the legalization of same-sex marriage and other L.G.B.T. civil rights milestones.For her influential four-minute film “Dyketactics” (1974), she shot about a dozen nude women in sensual montages in an idyllic forest setting in Napa Valley and added scenes of herself making love to a girlfriend. She called it her “lesbian commercial.” Two years later, in “Multiple Orgasm,” she showed alternating close-ups of a woman masturbating and her ecstatic face.“One of my goals was to put a lesbian on camera — on film — in the 20th century and now into the 21st century, because when I began there weren’t any that I could find,” she told Nomorepotlucks, an online art, culture and politics journal, in a 2009 interview.Over the next 40 years she made dozens of films and videos. Working mostly with eight-millimeter, Super 8 and 16-millimeter film, Ms. Hammer produced and directed essaylike films and documentaries, often abstract and devoid of traditional narrative structure, ranging from a few minutes long to feature length.“Hammer strives in her films for a new visual language, a new way of presenting images that disrobes the conventions of the straight realm and reimagines the garb of our queer world in all its underground pathos, sexuality, playfulness and positively perverse gaze,” the poet Janlori Goldman wrote on the website of the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in Manhattan in 2017, when the museum held an exhibition of Ms. Hammer’s work.Ms. Hammer delved into lesbian history and culture through the stories of artists like the photographer Alice Austen (in the documentary “The Female Closet”) and the poet Elizabeth Bishop (“Welcome to This House”). She explored menstruation (“Menses”), coverage of the AIDS epidemic (“Snow Job”) and how women view their sexuality compared with male images of women and sex (“No No Nooky T.V.”).Not all her films were about lesbianism or sexuality. Her subjects also included women in the Korean Islands who dive for shellfish (“Diving Women of Jeju-do”); the artists Henri Matisse and Henri Bonnard’s work during World War II (“Resisting Paradise”); and the fragility of the human body as seen through X-rays (“Sanctus”).But, she told the Smithsonian archive, “I have never separated my sexuality from my art, even if the film has nothing to do with lesbian representation.”Barbara Jean Hammer was born on May 15, 1939, in Los Angeles and grew up in nearby Inglewood. Her father, John, owned a gas station, and her mother, Marian (Kusz) Hammer, was a secretary.Barbara studied psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and married Clayton Ward a day after her graduation. They stayed married for nine years before she left him and came out.She earned a master’s degree in English literature from San Francisco State College (now University) and began painting in acrylics. But by the time she earned honorable mention for an early film, “Schizy” (1968), at a Super 8 film festival in Sonoma County, she had turned her attention to moviemaking.“The experience of watching it projected with an audience was incredible,” she said in 1990 in an interview for Art Papers magazine. “The film was larger than any canvas I’d painted, and the audience was captured by the darkness and direction of light to watch my work in a way no one had looked at my paintings.“That was it. I was a filmmaker.”But it would take a few more years, until she was studying film history at San Francisco State (where she earned her second master’s), that she recognized what she might contribute as a female moviemaker. She had watched “Meshes of the Afternoon” (1943), a short experimental film written and co-directed by Maya Deren.“I knew there was room for a woman’s vision on the screen,” she said in the Art Papers interview. Her first 16-millimeter film, “I Was/I Am” — in which, she said, “I go through a transformation from a princess to a dyke” — was a homage to Ms. Deren.Her films, often produced on a shoestring, did not reach a mainstream audience. But she received several honors, including a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship, which helped finance “Welcome to This House” (2015), her film about Elizabeth Bishop, and three Teddy Awards, for short films about L.G.B.T. subjects, from the Berlin International Film Festival. She also had retrospectives of her work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London.In addition to Ms. Burke, a mental health clinician and human rights activist, Ms. Hammer is survived by her sister, Marcia Ebert.In 2006, Ms. Hammer received a diagnosis of Stage 3 ovarian cancer, which prompted her to make “A Horse Is Not a Metaphor” (2008), an intensely personal film that follows her to chemotherapy sessions that culminate with her remission and then shows her happily riding horses in Wyoming and New Mexico. She unflinchingly shows herself nude, losing her hair and receiving chemotherapy through a port in her abdomen.A retrospective of her work, “In This Body,” is scheduled to open on June 1 at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University. It will feature a three-channel video installation of a new work, “Evidentiary Bodies,” an immersive synthesis of her career and her bouts with cancer. It includes images of her M.R.I. scans projected onto her body.Jennifer Lange, curator of the film and video studio at the museum, said of Ms. Hammer in a telephone interview: “Her works says, ‘Here is what a female body is: It menstruates, it has various pleasures, it gets old and wrinkly, but it remains incredibly vital, even in illness, with unique sensory and biological systems.’ ”AdvertisementSupported byBy Dana GoldsteinHigh school counselors are often students’ biggest advocates, whether guiding teenagers through depression or the stress of SAT tests and college essays.But in the federal investigation of corrupt admissions practices unveiled last week, some were seen as obstacles to be pushed aside.The F.B.I. affidavit revealed how wealthy parents and William Singer, a private admissions consultant, lied to counselors about why students planned to take the SAT and ACT in far-flung locations, where bribed proctors would correct their answers. They rehearsed stories about falsified athletic records, claiming that although a student was not on their school’s sports team, he or she had played over the summer in Italy, or as part of a private club.The vast majority of private admissions consulting is perfectly legal. But the indictments last week pointed to an awkward reality for the nation’s high school counselors: with the growth of the multibillion-dollar college-prep industry, their role in the application process has become blurrier, especially in affluent communities where parents can pay for outside help. Even if they try to stop unethical behavior, the scandal shows it is impossible for them to police every wayward college applicant.For school counselors working in lower-income areas, the investigation was a stinging reminder of the steep odds their students face in a process where parental wealth plays a major role.[Read: Catch up on the latest news in the college admissions scandal.]Loretta Whitson, executive director of the California Association of School Counselors, said she would like to see state regulations ensuring that consultants “cannot give false information to kids,” such as guaranteeing admission to a particular school.Even when a family hires a consultant, she said, school-based counselors still play an important role. They are the only ones who can write the counselor recommendation letters required by many colleges, for example, or who can access and send out transcripts.While it is ultimately a student’s responsibility to sign applications and attest to their truthfulness, school counselors across the country said that part of their role was encouraging ethical behavior during application season.Katherine Pastor-Lorents, a counselor at Flagstaff High School in Arizona, said one common problem she saw was parents trying to do their children’s applications for them.“Are you going to college, or are your students going to college?” she asks them.Few families at her school hire private consultants, she said, and in recent days she has had to reassure students who had heard about the admissions scandal.“Kids can be kind of cynical and say, ‘There goes my spot,’” she said. “Now we’re trying to have those conversations in our school building about right and wrong, and how hard work can pay off, because that’s what they’ve always been taught.”Dwight Schmidt, a counselor at Beckman High School in Irvine, Calif., said that several years ago, he had two students who claimed to have won awards for working in a foreign orphanage. He was skeptical, so he asked for the name of the orphanage and who their supervisor had been. The girls broke down crying and admitted the story was fabricated.If he sees “embellishments,” Mr. Schmidt said, he will call them out.His school has a comprehensive college-planning process that begins in 11th grade and includes help on essays and one-on-one assistance with applications, he said. Still, like most public school counselors, Mr. Schmidt said he spent more time dealing with social and emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, than he did on college admissions.Mr. Schmidt acknowledged that counselors are sometimes overwhelmed. His own case load ranges between 575 and 600 students, about 130 of whom are seniors.Nationally, the average school counselor had a 464-student caseload during the 2015-16 school year, according to the American School Counselor Association. The group recommends no more than 250 students per counselor.Private admissions consulting is common in Irvine. Mr. Schmidt estimated that 15 to 20 percent of seniors at his school hired outside help, with some parents paying up to $8,000 per month to keep a consultant on retainer. While consultants can help alleviate tension between parents and children over deadlines and to-do lists, he said, he warned that families should be skeptical of some of the claims that consultants make, especially if they promise to help conceal a problem such as a disciplinary infraction.The federal investigation of Mr. Singer, his clients and the college employees they bribed revealed they were often anxious about being found out by suspicious school counselors.When one counselor reached out to the University of Southern California to question how the son of Devin Sloane, a Los Angeles businessman, could be admitted as a water polo player when he did not play on a school water polo team, Mr. Sloane was irate, according to court documents. “The more I think about this, it is outrageous!” he wrote in an email to Mr. Singer. “They have no business or legal right considering all the students [sic] privacy issues.”While school counselors sometimes do flag problematic applications, Emmi Harward, executive director of the Association of College Counselors in Independent Schools, said they should not be expected to be fact checkers.“That just isn’t feasible or realistic,” she said, adding that some students are not comfortable sharing their essays or other application materials with school staff, especially if they are writing about a personal problem.Ms. Harward said that although private-school admissions counselors, like the ones in her association, tend to have manageable case loads of 40 to 75 students per grade, the use of outside consultants remains common among private-school families in cities like New York and Los Angeles.School-based counselors and private consultants are often wary of one another, but both sides agreed that the relationship can be productive.An effective and ethical private consultant will often call a school counselor to learn more about a student’s grades, classroom demeanor and strengths and weaknesses, said Mark H. Sklarow, chief executive of the Independent Educational Consultants Association.Good consultants, he said, have typically visited more colleges than counselors have time to visit, and can have deeper expertise on how specific colleges deal with student disabilities or mental health issues.He conceded, however, that open communication between consultants and counselors was not always possible. Some high schools ask parents not to work with consultants — as at least one of the private schools embroiled in the admissions scandal did — and some consultants ask families not to reveal to schools that they have been hired.“We advise our members that the ideal is to always to be in touch, be on the same page,” Mr. Sklarow said. “At times the ideal isn’t going to come to pass.”Some school counselors said they felt far away from the world of high-priced consultants and elite admissions revealed by the federal investigation.“We have parents who can be overbearing, but we’ve never had to deal with a consultant,” said Desiré DeSoto, a counselor at Wai’anae High School in rural Oahu, where the majority of the students are Native Hawaiian. While students are able to take some free college classes on campus, less than 10 percent go on to attend four-year colleges, she said.One of her major responsibilities is helping students apply for financial aid. While the allegations in the federal indictment are shocking, she said she did not expect them to affect her community.“We’re kind of cynical already,” Ms. DeSoto said. “Nothing has ever been fair for us.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Mitch Smith, Jack Healy and Timothy WilliamsVERDIGRE, Neb. — Ice chunks the size of small cars ripped through barns and farmhouses. Baby calves were swept into freezing floodwaters, washing up dead along the banks of swollen rivers. Farm fields were now lakes.The record floods that have pummeled the Midwest are inflicting a devastating toll on farmers and ranchers at a moment when they can least afford it, raising fears that this natural disaster will become a breaking point for farms weighed down by falling incomes, rising bankruptcies and the fallout from President Trump’s trade policies.“When you’re losing money to start with, how do you take on extra losses?” asked Clint Pischel, 23, of Niobrara, Neb., whose lowland fields were flooded by the ice-filled Niobrara River after a dam failed. He spent Monday gathering 30 dead baby calves from his family’s ranch in this northern region of the state, finding their bodies under huge chunks of ice.“There’s no harder business to be in,” Mr. Pischel added. “But with death and everything else, you’ve got to answer to bankers. It’s not our choice.”Farms filing for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection rose by 19 percent last year across the Midwest, the highest level in a decade, according to data compiled by the American Farm Bureau. Now, many of those farmers have lost their livestock and livelihoods.The rail lines and roads that carry their crops to market were washed away by the rain-gorged rivers that drowned small towns, forced thousands of evacuations and killed at least three people. Some farmers say they have been cut off from their animals behind walls of water, while others cannot get to town for food and supplies for their livestock.Mapping the severity of the region’s flooding, which has killed three people.[Flooding in the Midwest: Here’s why the water is so high.]In Verdigre, also in northern Nebraska, the Ruzicka family has farmed for five generations, dating back to the homesteading days of the 1800s. The farmhouse is a total loss, a prized branding iron is missing and the family’s first tractor, a 1930s model that is still used sometimes, now sits overturned in a pond of mud, its red wheel pointed to the sky.“There’s not many farms left like this, and it’s probably over for us too, now,” said Anthony Ruzicka, whose alfalfa and corn fields were filled with giant ice chunks. “Financially, how do you recover from something like this?”The Ruzickas were still tallying the losses to their cattle herd. They scrambled to move cows to neighboring farms before the dam burst last week, but at least 15 newborn calves perished, and they believe the death toll is much higher.“We didn’t know what to do with them. We never, ever expected anything like this,” Mr. Ruzicka said Monday. “We just ran out of time. It was either sacrifice them or sacrifice ourselves.”Crisis has grown all too familiar for some people in the region. In Knox County, Neb., Hannah Sucha, 25, helped coordinate efforts to deliver emergency supplies including minerals, antibiotics and salt blocks to farmers hurt by the floods. Just two years ago, Ms. Sucha said, farmers and ranchers in the area were busy donating bales of their hay to ranches in Kansas and Oklahoma devastated by wildfires.“It’s going to affect them for years,” Ms. Sucha said. “You’re not going to be able to sleep at night because you’ve got so much loss.”Farm experts said it was too early to quantify the full economic toll of the floods, but Steve Wellman, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, said the disaster could cost the state’s livestock sector $400 million. Farm groups said it would take months or years to recover, and that residents across the region would need emergency federal aid.“You’ve got a generation of young farmers on the verge of leaving; you’ve got a lot of mental health stress out there — and that was before the storm,” said Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union. “You just pile this on top.”As floodwaters slowly ebbed in some places on Monday, other cities, including Fargo, N.D., were getting sandbags ready and bracing for floods from rivers overflowing with snowmelt and late-winter rains. And farmers in flooded rural areas were just starting to calculate losses and consider whether they would be able to get their fields ready for spring planting.In Holt County, Neb., Jerry Kohl, a rancher with 1,600 mature cows and 5,000 yearlings, lost dozens of cows over the past week, a loss in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. As he looked across his 30,000 acres on Monday, he saw more water than dirt.Mr. Kohl said he had spoken by phone to more than a dozen other ranchers in the area in the past few days and concluded that the damage caused by floodwaters and the deep freeze that preceded the flooding would force a number of ranches out of business.“I’m struggling, but there are others who have it a lot worse,” he said.Mr. Kohl, 60, said he had not slept for more than two hours at a time in nearly a week and had not tried to leave his ranch. As much as 70 percent of the land in Holt County is flooded, he said; the roads and bridges to the south and north are washed-out. Farmers and ranchers also said they had lost miles of fences that pen in their livestock and bales of hay that feed them.Ranchers are reluctant to acknowledge the death of their animals and blame themselves when it happens. But Mr. Kohl said he had lost about 40 calves during twin calamities of subzero cold and flooding. He said his son, two daughters and four hired workers had toiled in shifts to save as many animals as they could.“We’re proud of raising cows and taking care of them,” he said. “We don’t like to admit to anyone we lost even one cow.”Farmers said the losses were especially troubling because many cows were giving birth at this time of year, and the newborn calves came just as the blizzards were blowing and floodwaters were rising. Calves born under such conditions were at immediate and dire risk, Mr. Kohl said. “If you didn’t pick it up in 10 minutes, she wasn’t going to make it,” he said. “And we had all those babies out there.”He said that each calf had to be taken by hand into one of his four heated sheds, which are large enough only for about 10 calves each.Mr. Kohl’s focus now is on cows that are rejecting their calves because they were separated from them for as many as four days. “That’s telling her body she doesn’t need to make milk,” he said.He said an old rancher’s trick to try to reunite mothers and their young was to rub vanilla on a cow’s nose and then liberally dose her calf with the same liquid. That mingling of the same smell, he said, often did the trick.The future for cows without calves to care for is a bleak one.So many calves have been lost that some ranchers have decided to cut their losses and sell them now, instead of caring for mature cows until they are pregnant again. As a result, prices have dropped precipitously, from about $1 a pound for a 1,100-pound cow to 60 cents a pound.A cow that would have fetched $1,000 is now only worth $600.“Everybody, me included, is going to show a loss,” Mr. Kohl said.Mitch Smith reported from Verdigre, Neb., Jack Healy from Denver, and Timothy Williams from New York.Detective Brian Simonsen was killed in “friendly fire” during a robbery. This is his story, and that of a petty criminal who once wanted to be a police officer but is now charged with murder.Investigators searching for evidence near a T-Mobile store in Queens where officers fired 42 shots at a robbery suspect on Feb. 12, accidentally killing Detective Brian Simonsen.CreditCreditUli Seit for The New York TimesSupported byBy Ali Watkins and Ali Winston[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]One was an exemplary police officer, a veteran detective with an easy smile, a gift for talking to people and a deep knowledge of the characters in his precinct, on both sides of the law. He had made hundreds of arrests.The other longed to be a police officer when he was young, but evolved instead into the sort of neighborhood nuisance the police often have to deal with. At best quirky, and at worst emotionally disturbed, he amassed a long record of petty crimes, including impersonating a police officer. But recently, the police said, he had started robbing cellphone stores.The paths of the two men crossed at a T-Mobile shop in Queens last week. The veteran detective, Brian Simonsen, was among eight officers who responded when someone spotted a man forcing two employees into the store’s back office with a pistol.Moments later, Christopher Ransom, 27, emerged and pointed what turned out to be a fake gun at officers, jerking it as if he were firing, the police said.For 11 chaotic seconds, the police opened fire. Mr. Ransom and Detective Simonsen were both hit in the police fusillade. Only one would survive the night.“Make no mistake about it — friendly fire aside — it is because of the actions of the suspect that Detective Simonsen is dead,” the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said later that night at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The detective was 42 years old.Sgt. Matthew Gorman was also wounded in the crossfire. Mr. Ransom’s accomplice and lookout man, Jagger Freeman, sprinted away, only to be arrested several days later, the police said.Had they met under different circumstances, friends of the detective said, Detective Simonsen’s skill at calming down troubled people, coupled with Mr. Ransom’s desire to connect with the police, might have led to a less tragic outcome.Instead the Police Department will lay to rest on Wednesday one of its most well-regarded veterans, killed by friendly fire, as Mr. Ransom faces life in prison, charged with causing his death.Detective Simonsen, who had spent almost 19 years on the force, did not always want to be a police officer, his friends said. He felt a calling to help people through traumatic times, driven in part by the untimely deaths of his father and sister during his high school years.He grew up in Riverhead on Long Island and studied social work at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, where he also played catcher for the school’s baseball team. He worked in the social services field briefly before deciding to enter the New York Police Academy.Law enforcement proved an excellent fit for an athletic and affable man interested in psychology. Detective Simonsen began his career patrolling the 102nd Precinct in October 2000.He was among the first to respond to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with Officer Terrence LeGrady. It was an ordeal that made the patrol partners inseparable. Years later, Detective Simonsen would buy the house next to Officer LeGrady’s in eastern Long Island.In 2006, Detective Simonsen joined the precinct squad, where he became an expert on robbery cases.He and his partner at the time, Kevin O’Hea, were a fixture in the second-floor detective offices at the precinct, known for trading friendly banter with other officers and planning outings to Mets games.He spent his entire career in the 102nd Precinct, where he made 569 arrests and brought more than 130 felony indictments to the Queens district attorney’s office.His colleagues said he had a knack for convincing suspects to confess and for bonding with victims.“He had a very good way of putting people at ease,” Tim Shortt, an assistant district attorney in the Queens office, said of Detective Simonsen.In one case, Mr. Shortt recalled, Detective Simonsen was assigned to investigate a robbery that left a victim with a broken jaw. Detective Simonsen succeeded in getting one of the suspects to confess and to incriminate his partner. He then coaxed a confession out of the partner and had the man confirm his identity by signing the back of his own wanted flier.“He didn’t need a rubber hose to play a tough guy,” Mr. Shortt said. “He would have suspects laughing in the lineup room. He always acted decently toward them.”Even in cases where he had DNA evidence confirming a theory and a witness identification of a suspect, Detective Simonsen and his partner made a habit of trying to obtain a written confession.“We’d go talk to the guy because we felt like we needed him to tell us he did it,” said Mr. O’Hea, who retired in 2014.Though he loved the job, Detective Simonsen, who was a union delegate, had told friends he planned to retire soon if he did not receive a promotion to detective second-grade, a rank he had been nominated to receive.For younger officers in the precinct, Detective Simonsen was an anchor. One officer described him as “a cop’s cop.”“He knew the neighborhood, all the good guys, all the bad guys,” the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to a reporter. “Whether you’re a rookie or you’re a senior guy, he treated you the same. You always wanted to talk to Brian.”That reputation as a community pillar extended to Calverton, Long Island, where Detective Simonsen had settled with his wife Leanne, after meeting her on a trip to Las Vegas with mutual friends.Their neighborhood parties were legendary, including a particularly large bash Detective Simonsen threw last year for his grandfather’s 100th birthday.Detective Simonsen opted to make the 70-mile commute into the city rather than leave Long Island, where he played softball in the Riverhead police league.Though Detective Simonsen and his wife never had children, they kept the fridge stocked with snacks for the neighborhood kids. He had recently given his childhood baseball mitt to Officer LeGrady’s son, who also loved the game. His friends’ children called him Uncle Brian.His sister-in-law, Michelle Quinn, said Detective Simonsen had a deep love not just for his wife, but for her entire family in Chicago, which includes several police officers. “It was so easy to see the love between him and my sister,” she said.Ms. Quinn recalled how she had once admired her brother-in-law’s New York Islanders sweatshirt during one of his trips to Chicago. After he returned to New York, she found it in her house.“He left it for me, with a note,” she said. “Truly gives you the shirt off his back.”“The guy robbing the store,” Ms. Quinn added, her voice breaking. “Brian would have bought him a cellphone. He would have put him on his plan.”In the days since the shooting, police officials have described Mr. Ransom as a career criminal. For those who knew him, that description is not wrong, but does not tell the whole story, either.Mr. Ransom has been in and out of trouble with the law since 2010, with 25 arrests as a juvenile and an adult. Still, his adult criminal record does not include any violent crimes or involve weapons. His most serious convictions were for shoplifting. His other convictions were for actions that were more bizarre than menacing.“That’s what was kind of mind-boggling to me, to even see that he was in that situation,” said Larry Davis Nedd, a deacon at Brooklyn’s New Grace Tabernacle Christian Center, where he knew Mr. Ransom in his young-adult years.Friends, family and longtime neighbors of Mr. Ransom described a man of contrasts, prone both to deep displays of charity and to intense flashes of instability. He had trouble finding work.The one constant in his manic existence was a fascination with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, they said. Since he was a boy, Mr. Ransom had desperately wanted to become a police officer, recalled Frank Rios, a lifelong friend. But Mr. Rios said questions about Mr. Ransom’s mental health kept him from pursuing the job.Mr. Rios was not the only associate of Mr. Ransom’s who recalled emotional and mental health problems. Neighbors of Mr. Ransom’s mother in Ocean Hill, who had adopted him out of foster care, recalled her frustration with his tendency to act out in odd ways. She had taken him to counseling and had gotten him medication, one neighbor, Clemente Williams, said.“He wouldn’t take his meds and his mother would say he would go a little cuckoo,” Ms. Williams said. “He seemed to be an all-right guy but a little off.”Mr. Ransom’s sister, Patricia Rush, 46, also recalled that Mr. Ransom took medication for a mental condition as a child and was supposed to continue taking it into adulthood, though she did not recall what disorder he had. “He is supposed to be on medication right now,” she said.Quirks that appeared innocent in childhood grew darker and more serious as Mr. Ransom matured. After he failed to pursue a career as a police officer, he went to peculiar — and sometimes illegal — lengths to make inroads in the city’s justice system. He was prone to wearing fake policing gear in public. He donned it one morning in 2016 as he tried to nonchalantly enter Brooklyn’s 77th Precinct offices.Wearing a tactical vest and a fake badge that read “Super Police,” Mr. Ransom tried to gain access to restricted areas of the building. He was arrested, convicted of impersonating a law enforcement officer and spent 20 days in jail.Mr. Ransom was also convicted in 2012 of fraudulently claiming to be a college intern in order to gain access to restricted areas of the Kings County courthouse, including judges’ chambers.He was later convicted of criminal trespass and issued a protective order that forbade him from contacting two judges in the building. Court records show he violated that order the following year.In recent years, Mr. Ransom’s behavior spiraled erratically. He left his church, moved out of his old neighborhood and became estranged from friends and family, including his sister. Known as a prankster in childhood, Mr. Ransom began engaging in stunts aimed at gaining notoriety on the internet, his sister said. He posted some of his antics on his YouTube channel, tagged under “Christopher Ransom Productions.”In one 2016 post, Mr. Ransom can be seen wearing nothing but underwear and a cape, walking into a police station and thanking officers for their service.“I love you guys and I appreciate the N.Y.P.D,” he said, before leaping toward the exit.Whatever aspirations Mr. Ransom had in his youth, there were signs in recent days that he had abandoned hope of a normal life. On Jan. 17, he took to Facebook to voice frustration. “It took me 27 years to realize that I’m not a job type of dude,” he wrote.Two days later, the police said, Mr. Ransom was caught on a security camera as he robbed a cellphone store in Jamaica, Queens, holding a black handgun similar to the fake one he dropped when he was shot on Feb. 12.On Feb. 8, Mr. Ransom teamed up with Mr. Freeman, 25, to rob a T-Mobile store in the St. Albans neighborhood, brandishing a firearm and making off with about $1,000 and 25 iPhones, according to a criminal complaint.Mr. Ransom’s last social media update, posted the afternoon of Feb. 12, is a photo of himself in a trench coat, leaning against a bar with a bottle of Hennessy cognac. There is no description or caption.Five hours later, as rain and sleet coated the streets of Richmond Hill, Queens, Mr. Ransom and Mr. Freeman arrived in a car at the T-Mobile store on Atlantic Avenue at 120th Street, the police said. Mr. Ransom went in while Mr. Freeman stood watch outside, according to a criminal complaint.Just a few blocks away was Detective Simonsen, who had decided that night to go out on a shift, even though he had attended a union meeting earlier and was not required to work. He was eager to continue investigating a pattern of robberies with his supervisor, Sergeant Gorman, the police said.It was supposed to be a quiet night, polishing up reports and preparing for an upcoming review from headquarters. Neither the detective nor the sergeant were wearing bulletproof vests, the police said.Still, when the report came over the radio at 6:09 p.m. of a robbery at the T-Mobile store, the pair responded. They arrived at the same time as a patrol car.Sergeant Gorman, as the highest-ranking officer at the scene, entered the shop with two patrol officers to confront Mr. Ransom, who had already stuffed a duffel bag with cash. He had taken two employees into the back room of the store and demanded that they open a safe containing iPhones, when officers entered, according to police officials and two criminal complaints.Mr. Ransom came out of the back room holding up an authentic-looking imitation of a Colt pistol, court papers said. He advanced toward the door as officers backed out of the shop. As he approached the door, he raised a gun and made a motion to shoot.Police would later determine that the ensuing eruption of gunfire was from seven officers firing 42 bullets. Eight of them hit Mr. Ransom, who fell inside the store, his fake gun nearby. One wounded Sergeant Gorman in the thigh. Another mortally wounded Detective Simonsen, striking his vest-less chest.Twenty-four hours later, Mr. Ransom, who once dreamed of becoming a police officer, would be accused of causing the death of one. Mr. Ransom and Mr. Freeman have both been charged with murder.And from Chicago to the eastern reaches of Long Island, the beloved officer’s friends and family members would be struggling to grasp how a quiet night went so horribly wrong.“Brian was such a fun jokester, I’m hoping somehow it’s a big joke,” Ms. Quinn, his sister-in-law, said.“Just know he was the best.”Nate Schweber and Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting.Follow Ali Watkins and Ali Winston on Twitter: @AliWatkins @awinston AdvertisementSupported byBy Charlotte Graham-McLay, Austin Ramzy and Daniel VictorWELLINGTON, New Zealand — At least 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a horrific and methodical afternoon slaughter, part of which was broadcast live on the internet after the publication of a white supremacist manifesto online.The massacre, which Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, condemned as a terrorist attack and called “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” interrupted a day of prayer for a small immigrant community in the nation’s third-largest city and shook a country with little history of mass shooting.Harrowing first-person footage, apparently from a camera worn by a gunman as he attacked the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city, was streamed on Facebook — a grim milestone in the evolution of terrorism that raised questions about how tech companies can block extremists from using social media to spread hate and inspire violence.[Follow our live briefing here.]Facebook said it quickly shut down the account, but a 17-minute video showing a man dressed in black shooting at fleeing worshipers and into piles of bodies with a semiautomatic rifle circulated widely online. In addition to those killed, at least 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children, the authorities said.The police said a man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder but declined to identify him. The police also said they seized several weapons and found two explosive devices on a vehicle.“This is and will be one of New Zealand’s darkest days,” Ms. Ardern said at a news conference.Schools in the downtown area were locked down for hours after the attacks as the police tried to determine whether the gunman acted alone. The authorities urged residents to stay indoors, asked mosques to close and cleared nearby Cathedral Square, where people had gathered as part of worldwide protests to demand action on climate change.New Zealand’s police commissioner, Mike Bush, said three other individuals found near the scene with weapons were also taken into custody, though investigators later said that one probably had nothing to do with the attacks.The shootings were first reported at about 1:40 p.m., around the time of the midday Friday prayer, when the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Mosque, about three miles east, would be most busy. The manifesto had appeared online minutes earlier.The document named both mosques, and links to it were posted on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for hosting message boards with extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to what appeared to be the gunman’s Facebook page, where he said he would soon broadcast live video of the attack.But it was not immediately clear whether the name on the page was that of the suspect, and the authorities declined to comment.Ms. Ardern said that many of the victims were most likely migrants to New Zealand or refugees.“Christchurch was the home of these victims,” she said. “For many this may not have been the place they were born. For many, New Zealand was their choice, the place that they chose to come to and committed themselves to, the place they chose to raise their families.”She added that New Zealand was likely targeted “because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it.”Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, said people were anxious for updates and were worried that friends or family members were among the dead.“Nobody’s answering their phones,” she said. “We don’t know if they’re at the hospital or out of reach. Some have posted that they are safe, but others have not.”Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from Muslims across the country to arrange the 49 funerals they would need to plan.Historians say Muslims have lived in New Zealand for more than 150 years, but the population has grown with immigration from war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in the 1990s and 2000s. In a country of nearly five million people, though, only about 46,000 identified as Muslim in the 2013 census.The video of the attack, which appeared to be recorded on a helmet camera, showed the gunman driving to the mosque and then opening fire even before he entered the building. For nearly two minutes, he shoots at fleeing worshipers before he runs back to his car and swaps weapons.He then is seen re-entering the mosque and opening fire again, methodically moving from room to room and shooting into piles of bodies slumped on the green carpets. Several victims can be seen in the footage, many lying on top of one another motionless in a corner of the room.After another few minutes, the gunman leaves again, gets in his vehicle and drives away, pausing occasionally to fire at pedestrians while talking to himself throughout.“There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” he says at one point.The police in New Zealand said they were working to remove the video from the internet and urged people not to share it.A live video posted to social media appeared to show the attack at Al Noor Mosque, where 42 people were killed. The clip appeared to have been taken from a camera worn by a gunman.3 The gunman’s video shows him driving away six minutes after the first shot.1 The gunman parked inthe alley next to the mosque,according to the live video.Al NoorMosqueDeans Ave.2 He openedfire at around1:40 p.m.Re-entered mosque and began firingResumed firingoutside the mosqueShot abystanderFirst shot firedParkedExited mosqueGot new gun fromparked carExitedmosqueDroveaway1 min.later234563 The gunman’s video shows him driving away six minutes after the first shot.1 The gunman parked inthe alley next to the mosque,according to the live video.SouthHagleyParkAl NoorMosqueDeans Ave.2 He opened fire ataround 1:40 p.m.Re-enteredmosque andbegan firingResumed firingoutside the mosqueShot abystanderFirst shot firedParkedExited mosqueGot a new gunfrom the parked carLeft mosqueDroveaway1 minute later234563 The gunman’s video shows him driving away six minutes after the first shot.1 The gunman parked inthe alley next to the mosque,according to the live video.Al NoorMosqueDeans Ave.South Hagley Park2 He opened fire ataround 1:40 p.m.Resumed firingoutside the mosqueRe-entered mosqueand began firingShot abystanderFirst shot firedParkedExited mosqueGot a new gunfrom the parked carLeft mosqueDroveaway1 minute later23456By Jin Wu and Allison McCann | Note: Times are local time.Facebook said it was alerted by the police shortly after the livestream started. “We quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,” Mia Garlick, a Facebook representative, said in a statement. “We’re also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware.”Before the shooting began, the gunman made a winking reference to an internet meme, telling viewers to “subscribe to PewDiePie,” a reference to the Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg. Mr. Kjellberg, who has been criticized for anti-Semitism over skits that he called satirical, said on Twitter that he felt “absolutely sickened” that the gunman had mentioned him.The video and Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.The author of the manifesto identifies himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia. He listed his white nationalist heroes, described his animosity toward Muslims and immigrants, and said he chose to use guns in the attacks to stir discord in the United States around the Second Amendment.Aman Singh, 26, who works at a convenience store close to the Al Noor Mosque, said he hid after hearing gunshots and seeing people stream past, bloody and crying.“My really good friend goes there,” he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend’s whereabouts.Mohammad Isam, a Bangladeshi journalist, posted a video of members of Bangladesh’s national cricket team who he said escaped the attack.Christchurch, with about 388,000 residents, is the biggest city on New Zealand’s South Island, hugging the Pacific Ocean coast.There hasn’t been a mass shooting in New Zealand since 1990, when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor in the seaside town of Aramoana.That shooting led to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on “military style semiautomatic weapons.”Gun owners must be licensed, a process that includes a review of criminal activity and mental health, attendance at a safety program, an explanation of how the gun would be used, a residence visit to ensure secure storage, and testimonials from relatives and friends.Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer. There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017. Since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were 11.But there are plenty of guns. There were 1.2 million registered firearms in a country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit.Charlotte Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand, and Austin Ramzy and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong.

Sign up here for the weekly Australia Letter.CANBERRA, Australia — In a small section of the Australian War Memorial, past softly lit halls displaying World War I and II battlefield dioramas, is an exhibit dedicated to the Iraq War. In the display cases are gas masks and uniforms, modern updates of those worn a century earlier when troops fought at Gallipoli and the Western Front. The accompanying text tells visitors that the “U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was motivated by concerns that the Iraqi regime continued to hold weapons of mass destruction.” The description goes on to chronicle Australia’s role in the 2003 invasion, which included committing special forces, carrying out naval and air operations, and training Iraqi troops. But it does not mention that the United States, Britain and Australia greatly exaggerated that threat, and no such weapons were found. Now that partial account of the war in Iraq, as well as Australia’s participation in the war in Afghanistan, is about to get a significant boost: The memorial — composed of cenotaphs, a research center and a museum — has received 498 million Australian dollars (around $350 million) in government funding to build new sections commemorating the country’s more recent foreign conflicts.Critics contend that the memorial’s expansion, to include a bigger focus on Iraq and Afghanistan, minimizes the enormous losses of earlier wars. Moreover, they say, the memorial’s administrators have sanitized the history of the present conflicts in order to legitimize ongoing deployments in Afghanistan and the Middle East.More than 30,000 Australian troops were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, and there are still about 1,600 service members in Afghanistan and across the Middle East. Forty-two Australians have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, and three have died in Iraq since 2003. Those death tolls pale in comparison to the more than 60,000 Australians who died during World War I, and the 39,000 killed in World War II — conflicts that were formative moments in Australia’s history.Nearly every schoolchild in the country will at some point visit the memorial. They are taught how Australia, by participating in the world’s most significant modern wars, emerged from Britain’s shadow to become its own nation. It is a place where military heroism is celebrated as a foundational national principle.The tone of the history presented in the memorial changed after the Sept. 11 attacks, said Peter Stanley, a professor at the University of New South Wales and the former principal historian at the memorial.“There was an increasing tendency from 2001 onward for governments of both persuasions to valorize Australian military history and to extol Australian military achievements,” he said, referring to Australia’s conservative and progressive governments, which have both supported the wars.Beyond questions of historical accuracy and the glorification of war, the expansion has also been criticized for its commercialism — the Afghanistan exhibition is sponsored by Boeing — the secretive process by which the government approved the plan, and concerns that the money could have been better spent to help veterans. Some of that criticism has focused on Brendan Nelson, the memorial’s director. Mr. Nelson was Australia’s minister of defense from 2006-2007, at the height of sectarian bloodshed in Iraq and a spike in suicide attacks in Afghanistan.His time as defense minister, Mr. Nelson said, “changed me in ways I didn’t really understand until I had finished.” When he became director of the memorial, he pushed for representation of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, even as thousands of troops remained there fighting.“If someone hadn’t been minister of defense, would they have come here and said, ‘We’ve got to change things, we’ve got to get an exhibition now?’” he said in an interview. “Certainly it drove me.” Knowing and visiting firsthand with the troops who fought and died for Australia gave him a “sense of the importance of their story being told,” he said.But many have asked whether the former defense minister is using his current position to burnish his own legacy and promote a whitewashed version of war. Sue Wareham, the president of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, said the memorial was presenting a version of history that was “avoiding the big picture, taking out bits and pieces that we want Australians to be proud of, and patriotic about, and doing it in a way that if you criticize you are against the troops.”Never has the tradition of celebrating the Australian soldier been more popular than it is today, wrote Peter Cochrane, a historian at the University of Sydney, “yet never have its defenders been more chauvinistic, bellicose and intolerant of other viewpoints.”The government has not made public any of the details for the memorial’s expansion, but administrators said one major focus would be Afghanistan.Some critics — including a former memorial director — are upset an award-winning building will be demolished to make room for new displays. Mr. Nelson plans to include exhibitions on veteran trauma and mental health, and feature the work of diplomats and foreign service officers in the field. Supporters believe the war in Afghanistan deserves the attention. It is Australia’s longest war, just as it is the United States’.“Seventeen years, and this is all we’ve got,” Chris Wagner, a spokesman for the memorial, said during a tour of the building and its grounds. “It’s not really fair, is it, when you think that 30,000 Australians have served our country in Afghanistan, and this is all the space we have to tell their story and they’re alive, they’re bringing their families here,” he said, pointing to a corridor that doubles as gallery space. “There’s little to show them of what they’ve done,” he said.Mr. Stanley, the former principal historian, said that using the length of time a war was fought as a way to compare conflicts was misguided.“Because we’re so close to the current conflicts, they might seem much bigger than they really are,” he said. “But if you look at it in a historical perspective, they’re not big conflicts and they don’t deserve disproportionate attention.”Mr. Nelson remains unmoved by the criticism. He rejected suggestions that displaying military hardware might contribute to the glorification of war, saying that damaged vehicles pulled from war zones would be displayed. But he also plans to install an F-111 striker jet, which has not played a role in any Australian combat operations. Funding for the expansion was arranged behind closed doors. Josh Frydenberg, the country’s treasurer, would not discuss the project’s price tag, other than to say in an interview that the government “thinks that it is a good investment.” The details of the cabinet’s decision are classified “secret” under the Freedom of Information Act.There is no investigation planned regarding the grant, and no members of Parliament have requested an audit, according to the Auditor-General’s office. Neville Bartlett, a retiree from Sydney, recently traveled to Canberra. He said that every time he came to the capital, he stopped at the memorial to honor two people: his great-uncle who perished in October 1918, and his Sunday school teacher who died six weeks after arriving in Vietnam.As long as Australia keeps fighting wars, he said, there will always be a need for a place like this.“It keeps going on,” Mr. Bartlett said. “You can’t make the original stuff go away just to fit in the new stuff.” AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoBy Nicholas Fandos and Noah WeilandWASHINGTON — Television crews have been positioned outside the offices of the special counsel, the federal courthouse and, at least before they were asked to leave, the McLean, Va., home of the new attorney general, William P. Barr.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are so desperate for hints that they are asking aides to call Justice Department contacts to beg for morsels.Publishing houses are scrambling to produce instant books of the findings. Newspapers are deploying small armies of reporters. At bars, restaurants, cocktail parties and street corners, people are asking one another the same question.When is it coming out?Washington — jittery, full of rumor, like a becalmed ship in the dead air before a coming storm — is waiting for the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his aides conspired in the effort or obstructed justice. It may or may not be the report of the century, it may or may not be ready soon, and it may be only a few pages long. But it is unquestionably one of the capital’s most anticipated documents since the Starr Report on President Bill Clinton arrived by the truckload on Capitol Hill in September 1998.Real information — actually, any information at all from Mr. Mueller’s astonishingly leak-free team — is almost nonexistent. “The folks who know aren’t talking, and the folks who don’t won’t stop,” said Antonia Ferrier, the former communications director for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.The result is energetic spinning from both parties, who have stepped into the void to try to frame the next chapter of Mr. Trump’s presidency.Democrats, worried that Mr. Mueller’s report will be a dud, are now casting it as one step in their coming investigations of a presidency flush with accusations of wrongdoing. They say the House, which they control, has a duty to conduct oversight, regardless of what the special counsel concludes.“I have the utmost respect for Mr. Mueller; I am accepting of whatever he brings,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. “But that cannot be the end of it.”As they wait, House Democrats are playing down talk of impeachment in favor of new congressional investigations that can absorb Mr. Mueller’s findings and provide continued scrutiny if the president is cleared. Their topics are familiar: Russian contacts, obstruction of justice, abuse of power and a scheme to buy the silence of a pornographic film actress who claimed an affair with Mr. Trump.“The mission of the House of Representatives is very different than Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation,” said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California and a member of the Judiciary Committee, the body where any impeachment proceedings would begin.Mr. Lieu said House Democrats would reject the premise that Mr. Mueller’s clearing Mr. Trump of personal coordination with the Russians would amount to any broader exoneration.“Just because he is cleared of one,” Mr. Lieu said, “doesn’t mean he is cleared of nine other ones.”The president and his allies are continuing to label the investigation an overreach — Mr. Trump prefers to refer to it in all caps as a WITCH HUNT — and have kept the bar for wrongdoing very high. Outwardly confident that Mr. Mueller will not find evidence of a conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Russia, they have routinely sought to reduce Mr. Mueller’s investigation to a single term — “collusion” — or bust.Anything short of that, including a charge of obstruction of justice, they insist, would justify having the whole inquiry dismissed.“If Mueller could not find anything with his overzealous but skilled, relentless investigators, the F.B.I., a grand jury and a discipline which is unknown to a congressional group, then multiple House Democratic committees will not be a search for the truth but a forum to launch attacks on the president,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, wrote in a text message over the weekend. As for acts that could be called obstruction of justice, Mr. Trump was rightfully exercising powers granted by the constitution, Mr. Giuliani added.As the president left the White House for Alabama and then his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last weekend, he made his confidence known. “Keep the hoax going,” he told reporters before heading into Marine One. “It’s just a hoax.”Republicans in Congress, while privately worried that Mr. Mueller could still deliver an unpleasant surprise, have provided backup. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, rounded up reporters on Friday to say that Democrats were launching a “fishing expedition” because they “don’t believe they are going to get what they’ve been asking for — and dying for — for two years.”In the meantime, guessing has dominated social gatherings in Washington, where debate over precedent often bounces from Whitewater to Watergate.On Monday night hundreds of people crowded into the Bier Baron Tavern near Dupont Circle to sip brews as Randall D. Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at nearby George Washington University, lectured on the Mueller investigation and presented a slide show with pub trivia. (Q: Who was the Russian charged as a co-defendant with Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, for witness tampering? A: Konstantin V. Kilimnik.) Mr. Eliason also played down any expectations that the president would be indicted or that the entirety of Mr. Mueller’s report would be available to ordinary citizens.“If you don’t charge somebody, you don’t write a report about it and release it to the public,” Mr. Eliason said. “That’s just not the way the Justice Department is supposed to work.”A mile up Florida Avenue in the busy Adams Morgan neighborhood, Lee Farmer, a city planner, and Elizabeth Rairigh, a historic preservationist, were drinking wine at the Jack Rose Dining Saloon, both worn out by constant news of the report’s coming release.“I have this constant anticipation of something,” Ms. Rairigh said. “Every day I’m disappointed.”Ms. Farmer said she recently gave up cable news — an improvement, she joked, for her mental health. She added of the report, “I’ll find out before I die.”On that topic,  an NPR report last week suggested that some elderly anti-Trump Americans have taken that sentiment seriously and are trying to stay alive until Mr. Mueller’s work is done.Inside the White House, preparation has not been much more extensive.There is no war room preparing to deal with Mr. Mueller’s findings and no intention to set one up, as Mr. Clinton did when he faced impeachment and possible removal from office. There are no calls with surrogates to line up a messaging plan. The president’s advisers are simply flying blind, said one person directly involved in the planning, who was not authorized to discuss it.Their problem is familiar. White House officials do not know for certain that the report will be sent to the White House for review for executive privilege issues before it is submitted to the Justice Department, not to mention what it will say.For those caught up in the special counsel investigation, the wait is even more freighted.“My family’s life has been on pause for two years, and we have been waiting to press play ever since the rumors of the end of the investigation,” said Michael R. Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who was questioned by Mr. Mueller’s team.The scrutiny has cost Mr. Caputo business and significant legal fees, he said, but he expressed optimism that the release of Mr. Mueller’s findings will allow him to move on.“So make with the report already,” he said.Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Zach Montague and Kenneth P.

But did we?By Zuzana Boehmová[A newsletter for parents with evidence-based guidance and personal stories for your transformed life with kids. Sign up to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.]Last spring, about a week into a family visit to Prague, my hometown, I overheard my then 2½-year-old son mumble to himself in Czech: “Are you trying to get a spanking?” (Chceš snad na zadek?)I was disturbed and shocked. I knew he’d never heard that from me. He had spent a lot of time with various members of our extended family by that point, so I set out to investigate who could have issued such a threat. But the inquiry proved difficult: Most members of my family in Prague believed themselves to be the likely source. There was no remorse. Children test limits, they said, while grown-ups threaten and occasionally spank. What’s the big deal?Like any Czech child of the ’80s and ’90s, I was familiar with this phrase, and its many variations. As children, we heard it from parents, teachers, music instructors, coaches — even friends’ parents. We knew the threat was real, because being on the receiving end of a spanking or a face slap was commonplace. I saw countless bare butts getting spanked in playgrounds and parks — a humiliation perfected.While I was lucky in that my parents used spanking sparingly, it was understood to be a possibility. For minor offenses, a verbal warning would come first. I knew, and feared, what could come next. Sometimes even a stern stare from my otherwise pretty bohemian dad indicated that clearly.Many of my friends’ parents were stricter, and the threats I overheard while visiting their homes suggested that they used creative props in punishing their children: If you don’t stop, you’ll get a smack with a leather belt, a fly swatter or a spatula. (My grandma once famously broke a wooden spatula while punishing my dad for failing to recite correct German nominatives and accusatives fast enough.) Sometimes my classmates would show up in school with jelito “blood sausage” marks on their behinds the day after the grown-ups around them had applied their parenting methods. One of my primary schoolteachers — Comrade Svobodová, as she liked to be called — preferred using a length of electrical cord, which left thin red lines on our hands.One summer day when I was around 9, a rare slap landed on my face during lunch when I hadn’t wanted to eat a bowl of soup. I was so humiliated that I cried with rage over the fickle and unreasonable world of grown-ups.Later that day, I wrote in my diary, in capital letters: I will never ever set a hand on my children when I’m a mom, and neither will anybody else.As I readied to have children of my own, none of this was on my mind. So much research had come out since I was a child, revealing the harms of corporal punishment, that I figured the question had been settled for good. “There is no need for corporal punishment based on the research,” Dr. Alan Kazdin, a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University, told the American Psychological Association. “We are not giving up an effective technique. We are saying this is a horrible thing that does not work.” Countless studies have shown that physical punishment — including spanking — can lead to increased aggression, antisocial tendencies and mental health problems. A 2018 study of 400,000 adolescents from 88 countries found that bans on physical punishment have helped to reduce youth violence.While Czech attitudes have evolved since I was a child, the majority still approve of spanking. About 63 percent of respondents in a recent Czech survey found corporal punishment acceptable in some cases. This is not unlike the United States, where polls show that around 70 percent approve of spanking — though there are regional, religious and racial disparities; and even a divide along party lines.I should add that Czechs’ proclivity for discussing spanking within my earshot is no coincidence. My two toddler boys, with a little under two years separating them, are masters of mischief. They can often be found busily taking child locks apart. The older one is so inventive in trying to annihilate his little brother that he recently took a vacuum cleaner and suctioned his dinner off a plate. The younger one disables appliances with swiftness and gusto. They drive my husband and me crazy and, short of hitting, we try all that we can.When I refuse to spank, even progressive Czechs around me seem to believe that I’ve adopted a sort of snotty, New Age-y approach. My father, today a successful self-made businessman, star negotiator and a doting and attentive grandpa, begs me: Just spank them already, and put an end to this misery! As my son, a little over 1 at the time, waddled toward a power outlet that I had just warned him away from for the third time, my dad lamented, “See, here? A smack over the hands. This could have been the teaching moment. It pains me greatly to see how hard you are making your own life.”I find it surprising that my compatriots, who famously disdain violence; overthrow governments peacefully; and are, after the trauma of Communist rule, often instinctively suspicious of authority, are the ones from whom I hear praise of “a firm hand” in parent-child interaction. Brutal beating appalls them, but what they call an “educational slap” is a wholly different thing. The implication seems to be that, without “educational spankings,” kids would run amok (like mine?), and traditional structures would eventually collapse.When I try to explain that most child care experts say that, while spanking may change behavior temporarily, children should be able to stop themselves from engaging in inappropriate behavior without the threat of physical punishment, I get eye rolls. The response usually goes something like this: “We were punished much more harshly than today’s kids will ever be, and look at us, no trauma, we turned out just fine.” But did we?I am very grateful for my childhood, for my parents’ kindness and open-mindedness (7-year-old vegetarians were not exactly commonplace in Communist cafeterias) and for their unfailing belief in me. But I turned out far from perfect and, while many factors are at play, it baffles me that more people don’t question whether we would not have fared better if physical force had been off the table. I have a complicated relationship with conflict and confrontation and, even as a child who was mostly threatened and rarely hit, I struggled to effectively navigate disagreements well into adulthood. I love my parents deeply but, to this day, I feel an irrational pang of fear each time I butt heads with my dad.Most importantly, I often feel myself at a loss when dealing with my own kids. When they upset me, I draw a blank on how best to react to their tantrums, frustrations or straight-up naughty behavior. My attempts to acknowledge their feelings and to offer solutions — “I see you are fighting over a toy and you are both upset, so how can we resolve that?” or “I can see you are frustrated and want to scream, but how about using your words?” — sound oddly formulaic in Czech, the language in which I speak to them. My mind supplies me with “Stop it this second, or … !” I try daily, but I still stumble through positive reinforcement and often end up sounding like a dishonest robot.
